LTD.\\n36 ESSEX STREET W.C.\\nLONDON\\n\\n_First Published by Methuen & Co. Ltd. in 1922_\\n\\n_This Edition on handmade paper is limited to 1000 copies_\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\\n\\n\\nThe very interesting and richly coloured masque or pantomimic play which\\nis here printed in book form for the first time, was invented sometime in\\n1894 or possibly a little earlier.  It was written, not for publication,\\nbut as a personal gift to the author\\'s friend and friend of his family,\\nMrs. Chan Toon, and was sent to her with the letter that follows and\\nexplains its origin.\\n\\nMrs. Chan Toon, before her marriage to Mr. Chan Toon, a Burmese\\ngentleman, nephew of the King of Burma and a barrister of the Middle\\nTemple, was Miss Mabel Cosgrove, the daughter of Mr. Ernest Cosgrove of\\nLancaster Gate, a friend of Sir William and Lady Wilde, and herself\\nbrought up with Oscar and his brother Willie.\\n\\nFor a long while Mrs. Chan Toon, who after her husband\\'s death became\\nMrs. Woodhouse-Pearse, refused to permit the masque to be printed.  The\\nlate Robert Ross much wanted to include it in an edition of Wilde\\'s\\nworks, of which it now forms a part, but he could not obtain its owner\\'s\\nconsent.  An arrangement, however, having been completed, the play is now\\nmade public.\\n\\n   TITE STREET, CHELSEA,\\n   _November_ 27, 1894\\n\\n   _My dear Mrs. Chan Toon_,\\n\\n   _I am greatly repentant being so long in acknowledging receipt of_\\n   \"_Told on the Pagoda_.\"  _I enjoyed reading the stories_, _and much\\n   admired their quaint and delicate charm_.  _Burmah calls to me_.\\n\\n   _Under another cover I am sending you a fairy play entitled_ \"_For\\n   Love of the King_,\" _just for your own amusement_.  _It is the outcome\\n   of long and luminous talks with your distinguished husband in the\\n   Temple and on the river_, _in the days when I was meditating writing a\\n   novel as beautiful and as intricate as a Persian praying-rug_.  _I\\n   hope that I have caught the atmosphere_.\\n\\n   _I should like to see it acted in your Garden House on some night when\\n   the sky is a sheet of violet and the stars like women\\'s eyes_.  _Alas_,\\n   _it is not likely_.\\n\\n   _I am in the throes of a new comedy_.  _I met a perfectly wonderful\\n   person the other day who unconsciously has irradiated my present with\\n   sinuous suggestion_: _a Swedish Baron_, _French in manner_, _Athenian\\n   in mind_, _and Oriental in morals_.  _His society is a series of\\n   revelations_. . . .\\n\\n   _I was at Oakley Street on Thursday_; _my mother tells me she sends\\n   you a letter nearly every week_.\\n\\n   _Constance desires to be warmly remembered_, _while I_, _who am\\n   bathing my brow in the perfume of water-lilies_, _lay myself at the\\n   feet of you and yours_.\\n\\n   _OSCAR WILDE_\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPRINCIPAL CHARACTERS OF THE PLAY\\n\\n\\nKING MENG BENG (_Lord of a Thousand White Elephants_, _Countless\\nUmbrellas and other attributes of greatness_).\\n\\nU.

THE KING _claps his hands_.  _The_ DANCING GIRLS,\\n_at the signal_, _advance_.  _They are clad in dresses made of fish\\nscales_, _which are fastened with diamonds and pale emeralds_, _to\\nimitate the upthrown spray on the crest of a wave_.  _The dance\\nconcluded_, _the_ CINGALESE AMBASSADORS _rise and prepare to take\\nceremonious leave of_ THE KING, _who hands to them_, _through his_\\nVIZIER, _his message to His Majesty of Ceylon_, _inscribed on palm leaves\\nand enclosed in a bejewelled casket_.\\n\\n_Many flowery speeches pass_.  _Exit_ (_L._), _walking backwards_.\\n\\nTHE KING _expresses a desire for rest before starting by the Moon of\\nTaboung _{4} _for the Pagoda of Golden Flowers_.\\n\\n_Exit_ MENG BENG (_C._), _an alcove of satin hangings which commands a\\nview of the great hall_.\\n\\n_The Crowd break up into groups_.  U. RAI GYAN THOO _and_ MOUNG PHO MHIN\\n_converse on the tendency of the King to interference in affairs of\\nState_; _his extreme youth and delicacy of temperament_; _the pity that\\nthe marriage is to be so long delayed_; _the necessity to find him some\\ndistraction in the meantime_.\\n\\n_Suddenly the tom-toms sound loudly_.  _There is much movement_.  _The\\nmoon rises over the sea_.  _Torches flare as the attendants move to and\\nfro in the gardens beyond_.\\n\\n_The White Elephant of the King_, _with its trappings of gold_, _is led\\nto the entrance where_, _at a word_, _it sinks obediently to the ground_.\\n\\nTHE KING _appears_.  _He has changed his gay apple-green dress to one of\\nmore sombre hue_.  _He enters the howdah_--_the elephant rises_--_the\\nprocession starts_.  _It consists of not fewer than two hundred persons_,\\n_keeping in view of the audience until lost by a bend in the avenue_.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCENE II\\n\\n\\nTHE PAGODA OF GOLDEN FLOWERS\\n\\nMidnight\\n\\n_Surrounded by Peepul-trees_, _the great Htee_, {6} _with its crown of a\\nmyriad jewels_, _rises towards the violet_, _star-studded sky_, _its\\ngolden bells tinkling in a soft night-wind_.\\n\\n_When the curtain rises_, _the circular platform is deserted_.  _Statues\\nof Buddha seated and recumbent fill the numberless niches in the wall_,\\n_and before each burn long candles_; _heaped-up pink roses and japonica\\non brass trays are lit from above by swinging coloured lamps_.  _At\\nintervals are stalls laden with fruit and cheroots_.  _All is\\nmysterious_, _solemn_, _beautiful_.\\n\\n_A deep Burmese gong tolls_.  _People emerge from the four staircases\\nthat lead up to the platform_.  _Men_, _women_, _and children_, _all in\\ngala attire_.  _The young people conversing_, _gesticulating_, _smiling_.\\n_The older people_, _more subdued_, _carry beads and votive offering to\\nBuddha_.  _Charming Burmese girls_, _with huge cigars_, _meet and greet\\nhandsome Burmese men smoking cheroots and wearing flowers in their ears_.\\n_Children play silently with coloured balls_.  _In the corners_, _under\\ncanopies_, _are seated fortune-tellers_, _busy casting horoscopes_.  _It\\nis a veritable riot of colour_, _with never a discordant note_.\\n\\n_Through the crowd_ THE KING _passes alone and unrecognised_, _and\\ndisappears through double doors of heavily carved teak wood_.  _He has\\nhardly passed when_ MAH PHRU, _a very lovely girl_, _enters in distress_.\\n_She whispers that she desires an audience of the King who has come\\namongst them_.  _The few who hear her shrug their shoulders_, _smile_,\\n_and pass on_.  _They are incredulous_.  _She goes from group to group_,\\n_but the people turn from her with disdain_.  _Then the great doors\\nopen_, _and_ THE KING _is seen_.  _The girl throws herself_, _Oriental\\nfashion_, _in his path_.  _Her beauty and her pathos arrest his attention\\nand he waves aside those who would interfere_.  _She implores_ THE KING\\'S\\n_protection_.  _She is willing to be his slave_.  _He listens with deep\\nattention_.  _She explains that since her father\\'s death she has been\\ncontinuously persecuted by the village people on the double count of her\\nItalian blood and her poverty_.\\n\\n_The girl invites him to come to her hut in the forest and verify what\\nshe says_.  _With a gesture he signifies that he will follow where she\\nleads_.  _She rises_.  _The crowd gathers round_--_all are hushed to\\nsilence_.  THE KING, _as one entranced_, _puts aside all who would in any\\nway interfere_.  _The girl precedes him_, _going from the Pagoda towards\\nthe night_.  _When she reaches the great staircase_, _she beckons_,\\n_Oriental fashion_, _with downward hand_.  _The scene should_, _in\\ngrouping and colour_, _make for rare beauty_.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCENE III\\n\\n\\n_A humble dhunni-thatched hut_, _set amidst the whispering grandeur of\\nthe jungle_, _with its mighty trees_, _its trackless paths_, _its\\nindescribable silence_.  _The curtain discovers_ MAH PHRU _and_ THE KING,\\n_who expresses his amazement at the loneliness and the poverty of her\\nlot_.  _She explains that poverty is not what frightens her_, _but the\\nenmity of those who live yonder_, _and who make it almost impossible for\\nher to sell her cucumbers or her pineapples_.  THE KING\\'S _gaze never\\nleaves the face or figure of the girl_.  _He declares that he will\\nprotect her_--_that he will build her a home here in the shadow of the\\nloneliness around them_.  _He has two years of an unfettered\\nfreedom_--_for those years he can command his life_.  _He loves her_, _he\\ndesires her_--_they will find a Paradise together_.  _The girl trembles\\nwith joy_--_with fear_--_with surprise_.  \"And after two years?\" _she\\nasks_.  \"Death,\" _he answers_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT II\\n\\n\\nSCENE I\\n\\n\\n_The jungle once more_.  _Time_: _noonday_.  _In place of the hut is a\\nbuilding_, _half Burmese_, _half Italian villa_, _of white Chunam_, _with\\ncurled roofs rising on roofs_, _gilded and adorned with spiral carvings\\nand a myriad golden and jewel-encrusted bells_.  _On the broad verandahs\\nare thrown Eastern carpets_, _rugs_, _embroideries_.\\n\\n_The world is sun-soaked_.  _The surrounding trees stand sentinel-like in\\nthe burning light_.  _Burmese servants squat motionless_, _smoking on the\\nbroad white steps that lead from the house to the garden_.  _The crows\\ncroak drowsily at intervals_.  _Parrots scream intermittently_.  _The\\nsound of a guitar playing a Venetian love-song can be heard coming from\\nthe interior_.  _Otherwise life apparently sleeps_.  _Two elderly\\nretainers break the silence_.\\n\\n\"When will the Thakin tire of this?\" _one asks the other in kindly\\ncontempt_.\\n\\n\"The end is already at hand.  I read it at dawn to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Whence will it come?\"\\n\\n\"I know not.  It is written that one heart will break.\"\\n\\n\"He will leave her?\"\\n\\n\"He will leave her.  He will have no choice--who can war with Fate?\"\\n\\n_The sun shifts a little_; _a light breeze kisses the motionless palm\\nleaves_--_they quiver gracefully_.  _Attendants appear R. and L. bearing\\na great Shamiana_ (_tent_), _silver poles_, _carved chairs_, _foot\\nsupports_, _fruit_, _flowers_, _embroidered fans_.  _Three musicians in\\nsemi-Venetian-Burmese costume follow with their instruments_.  _The tent\\nerected_, _enter_ (C.) MENG BENG _and_ MAH PHRU, _followed by two Burmese\\nwomen carrying two tiny children in Burmese fashion on their hips_.\\n\\n_The servants retire to a distance_.  MENG BENG _and_ MAH PHRU _seat\\nthemselves on carven chairs_; _the children are placed at their feet and\\ngiven coloured glass balls to play with_.  MENG BENG _and_ MAH PHRU _gaze\\nat them with deep affection and then at each other_.\\n\\n_The musicians play light_, _zephyr-like airs_.  MENG BENG _and_ MAH PHRU\\n_talk together_.  MENG BENG _smokes a cigar_, MAH PHRU _has one of the\\nbig yellow cheroots affected by Burmese women to-day_.\\n\\n\"It wants but two days to the two years,\" _he tells her sadly_.\\n\\n\"And you are happy?\"\\n\\n\"As a god.\"\\n\\n_She smiles radiantly_.  _She suspects nothing_.  _She is more beautiful\\nthan before_.  _Her dress is of the richest Mandalay silks_.  _She wears\\nbig nadoungs of rubies in her ears_.\\n\\n_Presently_ MENG BENG _arranges a set of ivory chessmen on a low table\\nbetween them_.  _The sun sinks slowly_.  _The sound of approaching wheels\\nis heard_.\\n\\n_Enter_ (_C._) U.

Few English plays have such a\\npeculiar history. Written in French in 1892 it was in full\\nrehearsal by Madame Bernhardt at the Palace Theatre when it was\\nprohibited by the Censor. Oscar Wilde immediately announced his\\nintention of changing his nationality, a characteristic jest,\\nwhich was only taken seriously, oddly enough, in Ireland. The\\ninterference of the Censor has seldom been more popular or more\\nheartily endorsed by English critics. On its publication in book\\nform \"Salom√©\" was greeted by a chorus of ridicule, and it may be\\nnoted in passing that at least two of the more violent reviews\\nwere from the pens of unsuccessful dramatists, while all those\\nwhose French never went beyond Ollendorff were glad to find in\\nthat venerable school classic an unsuspected asset in their\\neducation--a handy missile with which to pelt \"Salom√©\" and its\\nauthor. The correctness of the French was, of course, impugned,\\nalthough the scrip had been passed by a distinguished French\\nwriter, to whom I have heard the whole work attributed. The\\nTimes, while depreciating the drama, gave its author credit for\\na _tour de force_, in being capable of writing a French play for\\nMadame Bernhardt, and this drew from him the following letter:--\\n\\n     The Times, Thursday, March 2, 1893, p. 4.\\n\\n      MR. OSCAR WILDE ON \"SALOM√â.\"\\n\\n      To the Editor of The Times.\\n\\n      Sir, My attention has been drawn to a review of\\n      \"Salom√©\" which was published in your columns last\\n      week. The opinions of English critics on a French work\\n      of mine have, of course, little, if any, interest for\\n      me. I write simply to ask you to allow me to correct a\\n      misstatement that appears in the review in question.\\n\\n      The fact that the greatest tragic actress of any stage\\n      now living saw in my play such beauty that she was\\n      anxious to produce it, to take herself the part of the\\n      heroine, to lend to the entire poem the glamour of her\\n      personality, and to my prose the music of her\\n      flute-like voice--this was naturally, and always will\\n      be, a source of pride and pleasure to me, and I look\\n      forward with delight to seeing Mme. Bernhardt present\\n      my play in Paris, that vivid centre of art, where\\n      religious dramas are often performed. But my play was\\n      in no sense of the words written for this great\\n      actress. I have never written a play for any actor or\\n      actress, nor shall I ever do so. Such work is for the\\n      artisan in literature--not for the artist.\\n\\n      I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,\\n\\n      OSCAR WILDE.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen \"Salom√©\" was translated into English by Lord Alfred Douglas,\\nthe illustrator, Aubrey Beardsley, shared some of the obloquy\\nheaped on Wilde. It is interesting that he should have found\\ninspiration for his finest work in a play he never admired and by\\na writer he cordially disliked. The motives are, of course, made\\nto his hand, and never was there a more suitable material for\\nthat odd tangent art in which there are no tactile values. The\\namusing caricatures of Wilde which appear in the _Frontispiece_,\\n\"Enter Herodias\" and \"The Eyes of Herod,\" are the only pieces of\\nvraisemblance in these exquisite designs. The colophon is a real\\nmasterpiece and a witty criticism of the play as well.\\n\\nOn the production of \"Salom√©\" by the New Stage Club in May,\\n1905,[1] the dramatic critics again expressed themselves\\nvehemently, vociferating their regrets that the play had been\\ndragged from its obscurity. The obscure drama, however, had\\nbecome for five years past part of the literature of Europe. It\\nis performed regularly or intermittently in Holland, Sweden,\\nItaly, France, and Russia, and it has been translated into every\\nEuropean language, including the Czech. It forms part of the\\nrepertoire of the German stage, where it is performed more often\\nthan any play by any English writer except Shakespeare. Owing,\\nperhaps, to what I must call its _obscure_ popularity in the\\ncontinental theatres, Dr. Strauss was preparing his remarkable\\nopera at the very moment when there appeared the criticisms to\\nwhich I refer, and since the production of the opera in Dresden\\nin December, 1905, English musical journalists and correspondents\\nalways refer to the work as founded on Wilde\\'s drama. That is the\\nonly way in which they can evade an awkward truth--a palpable\\ncontravention to their own wishes and theories. The music,\\nhowever, has been set to the actual words of \"Salom√©\" in Madame\\nHedwig Lachmann\\'s admirable translation. The words have not been\\ntransfigured into ordinary operatic nonsense to suit the score,\\nor the susceptibilities of the English people. I observe that\\nadmirers of Dr. Strauss are a little mortified that the great\\nmaster should have found an occasion for composition in a play\\nwhich they long ago consigned to oblivion and the shambles of\\nAubrey Beardsley. Wilde himself, in a rhetorical period, seems to\\nhave contemplated the possibility of his prose drama for a\\nmusical theme. In \"De Profundis\" he says: \"The refrains, whose\\nrecurring motifs make \\'Salom√©\\' so like a piece of music, and bind\\nit together as a ballad.\"\\n\\nHe was still incarcerated in 1896, when Mons. Luigne Po√´ produced\\nthe play for the first time at the Th√©√¢tre Libre in Paris, with\\nLina Muntz in the title role. A rather pathetic reference to this\\noccasion occurs in a letter Wilde wrote to me from Reading:--\\n\\n\"Please say how gratified I was at the performance of my play,\\nand have my thanks conveyed to Luigne Po√´. It is something that\\nat a time of disgrace and shame I should still be regarded as an\\nartist. I wish I could feel more pleasure, but I seem dead to all\\nemotions except those of anguish and despair. However, please let\\nLuigne Po√´ know that I am sensible of the honour he has done me.\\nHe is a poet himself. Write to me in answer to this, and try and\\nsee what Lemaitre, Bauer, and Sarcey said of \\'Salom√©.\\'\"\\n\\nThe bias of personal friendship precludes me from praising or\\ndefending \"Salom√©,\" even if it were necessary to do so. Nothing I\\nmight say would add to the reputation of its detractors. Its\\nsources are obvious; particularly Flaubert and Maeterlinck, in\\nwhose peculiar and original style it is an essay. A critic, for\\nwhom I have a greater regard than many of his contemporaries,\\nsays that \"Salom√©\" is only a catalogue; but a catalogue can be\\nintensely dramatic, as we know when the performance takes place\\nat Christie\\'s; few plays are more exciting than an auction in\\nKing Street when the stars are fighting _for_ Sisera.\\n\\nIt has been remarked that Wilde confuses Herod the Great (_Mat._\\nxi. 1), Herod Antipas (_Mat._ xiv. 3), and Herod Agrippa (Acts\\nxiii), but the confusion is intentional, as in medi√¶val mystery\\nplays Herod is taken for a type, not an historical character, and\\nthe criticism is about as valuable as that of people who\\nlaboriously point out the anachronisms in Beardsley\\'s designs.\\nWith reference to the charge of plagiarism brought against\\n\"Salom√©\" and its author, I venture to mention a personal\\nrecollection.\\n\\nWilde complained to me one day that someone in a well-known novel\\nhad stolen an idea of his. I pleaded in defence of the culprit\\nthat Wilde himself was a fearless literary thief. \"My dear\\nfellow,\" he said, with his usual drawling emphasis, \"when I see a\\nmonstrous tulip with four wonderful petals in someone else\\'s\\ngarden, I am impelled to grow a monstrous tulip with five\\nwonderful petals, but that is no reason why someone should grow a\\ntulip with only three petals.\" THAT WAS OSCAR WILDE.\\n\\nROBERT ROSS.\\n\\n\\n[1] A more recent performance of \"Salom√©\" (1906), by the Literary\\nTheatre Club, has again produced an ebullition of rancour and\\ndeliberate misrepresentation on the part of the dramatic critics,\\nthe majority of whom are anxious to parade their ignorance of the\\ncontinental stage. The production was remarkable on account of\\nthe beautiful dresses and mounting, for which Mr. Charles\\nRicketts was responsible, and the marvellous impersonation of\\nHerod by Mr. Robert Farquharson. Wilde used to say that \"Salom√©\"\\nwas a mirror in which everyone could see himself. The artist,\\nart; the dull, dulness; the vulgar, vulgarity.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nLIST OF THE PICTURES BY AUBREY BEARDSLEY.\\n\\n1. THE WOMAN IN THE MOON. 2. TITLE PAGE. 3. COVER DESIGN. 4.

She is like a little princess who wears a\\nyellow veil, and whose feet are of silver. She is like a princess\\nwho has little white doves for feet. You would fancy she was\\ndancing.\\n\\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\\n\\nShe is like a woman who is dead. She moves very slowly.\\n\\n[_Noise in the banqueting-hall._]\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nWhat an uproar! Who are those wild beasts howling?\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nThe Jews. They are always like that. They are disputing about\\ntheir religion.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nWhy do they dispute about their religion?\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nI cannot tell. They are always doing it. The Pharisees, for\\ninstance, say that there are angels, and the Sadducees declare\\nthat angels do not exist.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nI think it is ridiculous to dispute about such things.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nHow beautiful is the Princess Salom√© to-night!\\n\\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\\n\\nYou are always looking at her. You look at her too much. It is\\ndangerous to look at people in such fashion. Something terrible\\nmay happen.\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: THE PEACOCK SKIRT]\\n\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nShe is very beautiful to-night.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nThe Tetrarch has a sombre look.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nYes; he has a sombre look.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nHe is looking at something.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nHe is looking at some one.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nAt whom is he looking?\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nI cannot tell.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nHow pale the Princess is! Never have I seen her so pale. She is\\nlike the shadow of a white rose in a mirror of silver.\\n\\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\\n\\nYou must not look at her. You look too much at her.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nHerodias has filled the cup of the Tetrarch.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nIs that the Queen Herodias, she who wears a black mitre sewn with\\npearls, and whose hair is powdered with blue dust?\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nYes; that is Herodias, the Tetrarch\\'s wife.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nThe Tetrarch is very fond of wine. He has wine of three sorts.\\nOne which is brought from the Island of Samothrace, and is purple\\nlike the cloak of C√¶sar.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nI have never seen C√¶sar.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nAnother that comes from a town called Cyprus, and is yellow like\\ngold.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nI love gold.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nAnd the third is a wine of Sicily. That wine is red like blood.\\n\\nTHE NUBIAN\\n\\nThe gods of my country are very fond of blood. Twice in the year\\nwe sacrifice to them young men and maidens; fifty young men and\\na hundred maidens. But it seems we never give them quite enough,\\nfor they are very harsh to us.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nIn my country there are no gods left. The Romans have driven them\\nout. There are some who say that they have hidden themselves in\\nthe mountains, but I do not believe it. Three nights I have been\\non the mountains seeking them everywhere. I did not find them.\\nAnd at last I called them by their names, and they did not come.\\nI think they are dead.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nThe Jews worship a God that you cannot see.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nI cannot understand that.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nIn fact, they only believe in things that you cannot see.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nThat seems to me altogether ridiculous.\\n\\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\\n\\nAfter me shall come another mightier than I. I am not worthy so\\nmuch as to unloose the latchet of his shoes. When he cometh, the\\nsolitary places shall be glad. They shall blossom like the lily.\\nThe eyes of the blind shall see the day, and the ears of the deaf\\nshall be opened. The new-born child shall put his hand upon the\\ndragon\\'s lair, he shall lead the lions by their manes.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nMake him be silent. He is always saying ridiculous things.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nNo, no. He is a holy man. He is very gentle, too. Every day, when\\nI give him to eat he thanks me.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nWho is he?\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nA prophet.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nWhat is his name?\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nJokanaan.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nWhence comes he?\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nFrom the desert, where he fed on locusts and wild honey. He was\\nclothed in camel\\'s hair, and round his loins he had a leathern\\nbelt. He was very terrible to look upon. A great multitude used\\nto follow him. He even had disciples.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nWhat is he talking of?\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nWe can never tell. Sometimes he says terrible things, but it is\\nimpossible to understand what he says.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nMay one see him?\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nNo. The Tetrarch has forbidden it.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nThe Princess has hidden her face behind her fan! Her little white\\nhands are fluttering like doves that fly to their dove-cots. They\\nare like white butterflies. They are just like white butterflies.\\n\\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\\n\\nWhat is that to you? Why do you look at her? You must not look at\\nher.... Something terrible may happen.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\n[_Pointing to the cistern._]\\n\\nWhat a strange prison!\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nIt is an old cistern.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nAn old cistern! It must be very unhealthy.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nOh no! For instance, the Tetrarch\\'s brother, his elder brother,\\nthe first husband of Herodias the Queen, was imprisoned there for\\ntwelve years. It did not kill him. At the end of the twelve years\\nhe had to be strangled.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nStrangled? Who dared to do that?\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\n[_Pointing to the Executioner, a huge Negro._]\\n\\nThat man yonder, Naaman.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nHe was not afraid?\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nOh no! The Tetrarch sent him the ring.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nWhat ring?\\n\\n[Illustration: THE BLACK CAPE]\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nThe death-ring. So he was not afraid.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nYet it is a terrible thing to strangle a king.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nWhy? Kings have but one neck, like other folk.\\n\\nTHE CAPPADOCIAN\\n\\nI think it terrible.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nThe Princess rises! She is leaving the table! She looks very\\ntroubled. Ah, she is coming this way. Yes, she is coming towards\\nus. How pale she is! Never have I seen her so pale.\\n\\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\\n\\nDo not look at her. I pray you not to look at her.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nShe is like a dove that has strayed.... She is like a narcissus\\ntrembling in the wind.... She is like a silver flower.\\n\\n[_Enter Salom√©_.]\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI will not stay. I cannot stay. Why does the Tetrarch look at me\\nall the while with his mole\\'s eyes under his shaking eyelids? It\\nis strange that the husband of my mother looks at me like that.\\nI know not what it means. In truth, yes, I know it.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nYou have just left the feast, Princess?\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nHow sweet the air is here! I can breathe here! Within there are\\nJews from Jerusalem who are tearing each other in pieces over\\ntheir foolish ceremonies, and barbarians who drink and drink, and\\nspill their wine on the pavement, and Greeks from Smyrna with\\npainted eyes and painted cheeks, and frizzed hair curled in\\ntwisted coils, and silent, subtle Egyptians, with long nails of\\njade and russett cloaks, and Romans brutal and coarse, with their\\nuncouth jargon. Ah! how I loathe the Romans! They are rough and\\ncommon, and they give themselves the airs of noble lords.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nWill you be seated, Princess?\\n\\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\\n\\nWhy do you speak to her? Why do you look at her? Oh! something\\nterrible will happen.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nHow good to see the moon! She is like a little piece of money,\\nyou would think she was a little silver flower. The moon is cold\\nand chaste. I am sure she is a virgin, she has a virgin\\'s beauty.\\nYes, she is a virgin. She has never defiled herself. She has\\nnever abandoned herself to men, like the other goddesses.\\n\\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\\n\\nThe Lord hath come. The son of man hath come. The centaurs have\\nhidden themselves in the rivers, and the sirens have left the\\nrivers, and are lying beneath the leaves of the forest.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nWho was that who cried out?\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nThe prophet, Princess.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nAh, the prophet! He of whom the Tetrarch is afraid?\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nWe know nothing of that, Princess. It was the prophet Jokanaan\\nwho cried out.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nIs it your pleasure that I bid them bring your litter, Princess?\\nThe night is fair in the garden.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nHe says terrible things about my mother, does he not?\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nWe never understand what he says, Princess.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nYes; he says terrible things about her.\\n\\n[_Enter a Slave_.]\\n\\nTHE SLAVE\\n\\nPrincess, the Tetrarch prays you to return to the feast.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI will not go back.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nPardon me, Princess, but if you do not return some misfortune may\\nhappen.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nIs he an old man, this prophet?\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nPrincess, it were better to return. Suffer me to lead you in.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nThis prophet ... is he an old man?\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nNo, Princess, he is quite a young man.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nYou cannot be sure. There are those who say he is Elias.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nWho is Elias?\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nA very ancient prophet of this country, Princess.\\n\\nTHE SLAVE\\n\\nWhat answer may I give the Tetrarch from the Princess?\\n\\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\\n\\nRejoice not thou, land of Palestine, because the rod of him who\\nsmote thee is broken. For from the seed of the serpent shall come\\nforth a basilisk, and that which is born of it shall devour the\\nbirds.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nWhat a strange voice! I would speak with him.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nI fear it is impossible, Princess. The Tetrarch does not wish any\\none to speak with him. He has even forbidden the high priest to\\nspeak with him.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI desire to speak with him.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nIt is impossible, Princess.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI will speak with him.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nWould it not be better to return to the banquet?\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nBring forth this prophet.\\n\\n                             [_Exit the slave._]\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nWe dare not, Princess.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\n[_Approaching the cistern and looking down into it._]\\n\\nHow black it is, down there! It must be terrible to be in so\\nblack a pit! It is like a tomb.... [_To the soldiers._] Did you\\nnot hear me? Bring out the prophet. I wish to see him.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nPrincess, I beg you do not require this of us.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nYou keep me waiting!\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nPrincess, our lives belong to you, but we cannot do what you have\\nasked of us. And indeed, it is not of us that you should ask this\\nthing.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\n[_Looking at the young Syrian._]\\n\\nAh!\\n\\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\\n\\nOh! what is going to happen? I am sure that some misfortune will\\nhappen.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\n[_Going up to the young Syrian._]\\n\\nYou will do this tiling for me, will you not, Narraboth? You will\\ndo this thing for me. I have always been kind to you. You will do\\nit for me. I would but look at this strange prophet. Men have\\ntalked so much of him. Often have I heard the Tetrarch talk of\\nhim. I think the Tetrarch is afraid of him. Are you, even you,\\nalso afraid of him, Narraboth?\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nI fear him not, Princess; there is no man I fear. But the\\nTetrarch has formally forbidden that any man should raise the\\ncover of this well.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nYou will do this thing for me, Narraboth, and to-morrow when I\\npass in my litter beneath the gateway of the idol-sellers I will\\nlet fall for you a little flower, a little green flower.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nPrincess, I cannot, I cannot.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\n[_Smiling_.]\\n\\nYou will do this thing for me, Narraboth. You know that you will\\ndo this thing for me. And to-morrow when I pass in my litter by\\nthe bridge of the idol-buyers, I will look at you through the\\nmuslin veils, I will look at you, Narraboth, it may be I will\\nsmile at you.

You would think it was the hand\\nof a dead woman who is seeking to cover herself with a shroud.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nShe has a strange look!

Bid her rise up from the bed of her abominations, from\\nthe bed of her incestuousness, that she may hear the words of him\\nwho prepareth the way of the Lord, that she may repent her of her\\niniquities.

They are like black\\nholes burned by torches in a Tyrian tapestry. They are like black\\ncaverns where dragons dwell. They are like the black caverns of\\nEgypt in which the dragons make their lairs. They are like black\\nlakes troubled by fantastic moons.... Do you think he will speak\\nagain?\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nDo not stay here, Princess. I pray you do not stay here.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nHow wasted he is! He is like a thin ivory statue. He is like an\\nimage of silver. I am sure he is chaste as the moon is. He is\\nlike a moonbeam, like a shaft of silver. His flesh must be cool\\nlike ivory. I would look closer at him.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nNo, no, Princess.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI must look at him closer.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nPrincess! Princess!\\n\\nJOKANAAN\\n\\nWho is this woman who is looking at me? I will not have her look\\nat me. Wherefore doth she look at me with her golden eyes, under\\nher gilded eyelids?

Thy body is white like the\\nlilies of a field that the mower hath never mowed. Thy body is\\nwhite like the snows that lie on the mountains, like the snows\\nthat lie on the mountains of Jud√¶a, and come down into the\\nvalleys. The roses in the garden of the Queen of Arabia are not\\nso white as thy body. Neither the roses in the garden of the\\nQueen of Arabia, the perfumed garden of spices of the Queen of\\nArabia, nor the feet of the dawn when they light on the leaves,\\nnor the breast of the moon when she lies on the breast of the\\nsea.... There is nothing in the world so white as thy body. Let\\nme touch thy body.\\n\\nJOKANAAN\\n\\nBack! daughter of Babylon! By woman came evil into the world.\\nSpeak not to me. I will not listen to thee. I listen but to the\\nvoice of the Lord God.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nThy body is hideous. It is like the body of a leper. It is like a\\nplastered wall where vipers have crawled; like a plastered wall\\nwhere the scorpions have made their nest. It is like a whitened\\nsepulchre full of loathsome things. It is horrible, thy body is\\nhorrible. It is of thy hair that I am enamoured, Jokanaan. Thy\\nhair is like clusters of grapes, like the clusters of black\\ngrapes that hang from the vine-trees of Edom in the land of the\\nEdomites. Thy hair is like the cedars of Lebanon, like the great\\ncedars of Lebanon that give their shade to the lions and to the\\nrobbers who would hide themselves by day. The long black nights,\\nwhen the moon hides her face, when the stars are afraid, are not\\nso black. The silence that dwells in the forest is not so black.\\nThere is nothing in the world so black as thy hair.... Let me\\ntouch thy hair.\\n\\nJOKANAAN\\n\\nBack, daughter of Sodom! Touch me not. Profane not the temple of\\nthe Lord God.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nThy hair is horrible. It is covered with mire and dust. It is\\nlike a crown of thorns which they have placed on thy forehead. It\\nis like a knot of black serpents writhing round thy neck. I love\\nnot thy hair.... It is thy mouth that I desire, Jokanaan. Thy\\nmouth is like a band of scarlet on a tower of ivory. It is like a\\npomegranate cut with a knife of ivory. The pomegranate-flowers\\nthat blossom in the gardens of Tyre, and are redder than roses,\\nare not so red. The red blasts of trumpets that herald the\\napproach of kings, and make afraid the enemy, are not so red.\\nThy mouth is redder than the feet of those who tread the wine in\\nthe wine-press. Thy mouth is redder than the feet of the doves\\nwho haunt the temples and are fed by the priests. It is redder\\nthan the feet of him who cometh from a forest where he hath slain\\na lion, and seen gilded tigers. Thy mouth is like a branch of\\ncoral that fishers have found in the twilight of the sea, the\\ncoral that they keep for the kings!... It is like the vermilion\\nthat the Moabites find in the mines of Moab, the vermilion that\\nthe kings take from them. It is like the bow of the King of the\\nPersians, that is painted with vermilion, and is tipped with\\ncoral. There is nothing in the world so red as thy mouth.... Let\\nme kiss thy mouth.\\n\\nJOKANAAN\\n\\nNever! daughter of Babylon! Daughter of Sodom! Never.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan. I will kiss thy mouth.\\n\\nTHE YOUNG SYRIAN\\n\\nPrincess, Princess, thou who art like a garden of myrrh, thou who\\nart the dove of all doves, look not at this man, look not at him!\\nDo not speak such words to him.

[_He kills himself and falls between Salom√© and Jokanaan._]\\n\\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\\n\\nThe young Syrian has slain himself! The young captain has slain\\nhimself! He has slain himself who was my friend! I gave him a\\nlittle box of perfumes and ear-rings wrought in silver, and now\\nhe has killed himself! Ah, did he not foretell that some\\nmisfortune would happen? I, too, foretold it, and it has\\nhappened. Well I knew that the moon was seeking a dead thing, but\\nI knew not that it was he whom she sought. Ah! why did I not hide\\nhim from the moon?

The Tetrarch does\\nnot care to see dead bodies, save the bodies of those whom he\\nhimself has slain.\\n\\nTHE PAGE OF HERODIAS\\n\\nHe was my brother, and nearer to me than a brother. I gave him a\\nlittle box full of perfumes, and a ring of agate that he wore\\nalways on his hand. In the evening we used to walk by the river,\\namong the almond trees, and he would tell me of the things of his\\ncountry. He spake ever very low. The sound of his voice was like\\nthe sound of the flute, of a flute player. Also he much loved to\\ngaze at himself in the river. I used to reproach him for that.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nYou are right; we must hide the body. The Tetrarch must not see\\nit.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nThe Tetrarch will not come to this place. He never comes on the\\nterrace. He is too much afraid of the prophet.\\n\\n[_Enter Herod, Herodias, and all the Court._]\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nWhere is Salom√©? Where is the Princess? Why did she not return to\\nthe banquet as I commanded her? Ah! there she is!\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nYou must not look at her! You are always looking at her!\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nThe moon has a strange look to-night. Has she not a strange look?\\nShe is like a mad woman, a mad woman who is seeking everywhere\\nfor lovers. She is naked too. She is quite naked. The clouds are\\nseeking to clothe her nakedness, but she will not let them. She\\nshows herself naked in the sky. She reels through the clouds like\\na drunken woman.... I am sure she is looking for lovers. Does she\\nnot reel like a drunken woman? She is like a mad woman, is she\\nnot?\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nNo; the moon is like the moon, that is all. Let us go within....\\nYou have nothing to do here.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI will stay here! Manesseh, lay carpets there. Light torches,\\nbring forth the ivory tables, and the tables of jasper. The air\\nhere is delicious. I will drink more wine with my guests. We must\\nshow all honours to the ambassadors of C√¶sar.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nIt is not because of them that you remain.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nYes; the air is delicious. Come, Herodias, our guests await us.\\nAh! I have slipped! I have slipped in blood! It is an ill omen.\\nIt is a very evil omen. Wherefore is there blood here?... and\\nthis body, what does this body here? Think you I am like the King\\nof Egypt, who gives no feast to his guests but that he shows them\\na corpse? Whose is it? I will not look on it.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nIt is our captain, sire. He is the young Syrian whom you made\\ncaptain only three days ago.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI gave no order that he should be slain.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nHe killed himself, sire.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nFor what reason? I had made him captain.\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nWe do not know, sire. But he killed himself.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nThat seems strange to me. I thought it was only the Roman\\nphilosophers who killed themselves. Is it not true, Tigellinus,\\nthat the philosophers at Rome kill themselves?\\n\\nTIGELLINUS\\n\\nThere are some who kill themselves, sire. They are the Stoics.\\nThe Stoics are coarse people. They are ridiculous people. I\\nmyself regard them as being perfectly ridiculous.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI also. It is ridiculous to kill oneself.\\n\\nTIGELLINUS\\n\\nEverybody at Rome laughs at them. The Emperor has written a\\nsatire against them. It is recited everywhere.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nAh! he has written a satire against them? C√¶sar is wonderful. He\\ncan do everything.... It is strange that the young Syrian has\\nkilled himself. I am sorry he has killed himself. I am very\\nsorry; for he was fair to look upon. He was even very fair. He\\nhad very languorous eyes. I remember that I saw that he looked\\nlanguorously at Salom√©. Truly, I thought he looked too much at\\nher.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nThere are others who look at her too much.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nHis father was a king. I drove him from his kingdom. And you made\\na slave of his mother, who was a queen, Herodias. So he was here\\nas my guest, as it were, and for that reason I made him my\\ncaptain. I am sorry he is dead. Ho! why have you left the body\\nhere? I will not look at it--away with it! [_They take away the\\nbody._] It is cold here. There is a wind blowing. Is there not a\\nwind blowing?\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nNo; there is no wind.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI tell you there is a wind that blows.... And I hear in the air\\nsomething that is like the beating of wings, like the beating of\\nvast wings. Do you not hear it?\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nI hear nothing.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI hear it no longer. But I heard it. It was the blowing of the\\nwind, no doubt. It has passed away. But no, I hear it again. Do\\nyou not hear it? It is just like the beating of wings.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nI tell you there is nothing. You are ill. Let us go within.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI am not ill. It is your daughter who is sick. She has the mien\\nof a sick person. Never have I seen her so pale.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nI have told you not to look at her.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nPour me forth wine [_wine is brought_]. Salom√©, come drink a\\nlittle wine with me. I have here a wine that is exquisite. C√¶sar\\nhimself sent it me. Dip into it thy little red lips, that I may\\ndrain the cup.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI am not thirsty, Tetrarch.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nYou hear how she answers me, this daughter of yours?\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nShe does right. Why are you always gazing at her?\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nBring me ripe fruits [_fruits are brought_]. Salom√©, come and eat\\nfruit with me. I love to see in a fruit the mark of thy little\\nteeth. Bite but a little of this fruit and then I will eat what\\nis left.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI am not hungry, Tetrarch.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\n[_To Herodias._] You see how you have brought up this daughter of\\nyours.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nMy daughter and I come of a royal race. As for thee, thy father\\nwas a camel driver! He was also a robber!\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nThou liest!\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nThou knowest well that it is true.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nSalom√©, come and sit next to me. I will give thee the throne of\\nthy mother.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI am not tired, Tetrarch.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nYou see what she thinks of you.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nBring me--what is it that I desire? I forget. Ah! ah! I remember.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE EYES OF HEROD]\\n\\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\\n\\nLo! the time is come! That which I foretold has come to pass,\\nsaith the Lord God. Lo! the day of which I spoke.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nBid him be silent. I will not listen to his voice. This man is\\nfor ever vomiting insults against me.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nHe has said nothing against you. Besides, he is a very great\\nprophet.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nI do not believe in prophets. Can a man tell what will come to\\npass? No man knows it. Moreover, he is for ever insulting me. But\\nI think you are afraid of him.... I know well that you are afraid\\nof him.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI am not afraid of him. I am afraid of no man.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nI tell you, you are afraid of him. If you are not afraid of him\\nwhy do you not deliver him to the Jews, who for these six months\\npast have been clamouring for him?\\n\\nA JEW\\n\\nTruly, my lord, it were better to deliver him into our hands.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nEnough on this subject. I have already given you my answer. I\\nwill not deliver him into your hands. He is a holy man. He is a\\nman who has seen God.\\n\\nA JEW\\n\\nThat cannot be. There is no man who hath seen God since the\\nprophet Elias. He is the last man who saw God. In these days God\\ndoth not show Himself. He hideth Himself. Therefore great evils\\nhave come upon the land.\\n\\nANOTHER JEW\\n\\nVerily, no man knoweth if Elias the prophet did indeed see God.\\nPeradventure it was but the shadow of God that he saw.\\n\\nA THIRD JEW\\n\\nGod is at no time hidden. He showeth Himself at all times and in\\neverything. God is in what is evil even as He is in what is good.\\n\\nA FOURTH JEW\\n\\nThat must not be said. It is a very dangerous doctrine. It is a\\ndoctrine that cometh from the schools at Alexandria, where men\\nteach the philosophy of the Greeks. And the Greeks are Gentiles:\\nThey are not even circumcised.\\n\\nA FIFTH JEW\\n\\nNo one can tell how God worketh. His ways are very mysterious. It\\nmay be that the things which we call evil are good, and that the\\nthings which we call good are evil. There is no knowledge of any\\nthing. We must needs submit to everything, for God is very\\nstrong. He breaketh in pieces the strong together with the weak,\\nfor He regardeth not any man.\\n\\nFIRST JEW\\n\\nThou speaketh truly. God is terrible; He breaketh the strong and\\nthe weak as a man brays corn in a mortar. But this man hath never\\nseen God. No man hath seen God since the prophet Elias.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nMake them be silent. They weary me.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nBut I have heard it said that Jokanaan himself is your prophet\\nElias.\\n\\nTHE JEW\\n\\nThat cannot be. It is more than three hundred years since the\\ndays of the prophet Elias.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nThere be some who say that this man is the prophet Elias..\\n\\nA NAZARENE\\n\\nI am sure that he is the prophet Elias.\\n\\nTHE JEW\\n\\nNay, but he is not the prophet Elias.\\n\\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\\n\\nSo the day is come, the day of the Lord, and I hear upon the\\nmountains the feet of Him who shall be the Saviour of the world.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nWhat does that mean? The Saviour of the world.\\n\\nTIGELLINUS\\n\\nIt is a title that C√¶sar takes.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nBut C√¶sar is not coming into Jud√¶a. Only yesterday I received\\nletters from Rome. They contained nothing concerning this matter.\\nAnd you, Tigellinus, who were at Rome during the winter, you\\nheard nothing concerning this matter, did you?\\n\\nTIGELLINUS\\n\\nSire, I heard nothing concerning the matter. I was explaining the\\ntitle. It is one of C√¶sar\\'s titles.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nBut C√¶sar cannot come. He is too gouty. They say that his feet\\nare like the feet of an elephant. Also there are reasons of\\nState. He who leaves Rome loses Rome. He will not come. Howbeit,\\nC√¶sar is lord, he will come if he wishes. Nevertheless, I do not\\nthink he will come.\\n\\nFIRST NAZARENE\\n\\nIt was not concerning C√¶sar that the prophet spake these words,\\nsire.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nNot of C√¶sar?\\n\\nFIRST NAZARENE\\n\\nNo, sire.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nConcerning whom then did he speak?\\n\\nFIRST NAZARENE\\n\\nConcerning Messias who has come.\\n\\nA JEW\\n\\nMessiah hath not come.\\n\\nFIRST NAZARENE\\n\\nHe hath come, and everywhere He worketh miracles.\\n\\nHERODIAS Ho! ho! miracles! I do not believe in miracles. I have\\nseen too many. [_To the page._] My fan!\\n\\nFIRST NAZARENE\\n\\nThis man worketh true miracles. Thus, at a marriage which took\\nplace in a little town of Galilee, a town of some importance, He\\nchanged water into wine. Certain persons who were present related\\nit to me. Also He healed two lepers that were seated before the\\nGate of Capernaum simply by touching them.\\n\\nSECOND NAZARENE\\n\\nNay, it was blind men that he healed at Capernaum.\\n\\nFIRST NAZARENE\\n\\nNay; they were lepers. But He hath healed blind people also, and\\nHe was seen on a mountain talking with angels.\\n\\nA SADDUCEE\\n\\nAngels do not exist.\\n\\nA PHARISEE\\n\\nAngels exist, but I do not believe that this Man has talked with\\nthem.\\n\\nFIRST NAZARENE\\n\\nHe was seen by a great multitude of people talking with angels.\\n\\nA SADDUCEE\\n\\nNot with angels.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nHow these men weary me! They are ridiculous! [_To the page._]\\nWell! my fan! [_The page gives her the fan._] You have a\\ndreamer\\'s look; you must not dream. It is only sick people who\\ndream. [_She strikes the page with her fan._]\\n\\nSECOND NAZARENE\\n\\nThere is also the miracle of the daughter of Jairus.\\n\\nFIRST NAZARENE\\n\\nYes, that is sure. No man can gainsay it.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nThese men are mad. They have looked too long on the moon. Command\\nthem to be silent.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nWhat is this miracle of the daughter of Jairus?\\n\\nFIRST NAZARENE\\n\\nThe daughter of Jairus was dead. He raised her from the dead.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nHe raises the dead?\\n\\nFIRST NAZARENE\\n\\nYea, sire, He raiseth the dead.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI do not wish Him to do that. I forbid Him to do that. I allow no\\nman to raise the dead. This Man must be found and told that I\\nforbid Him to raise the dead. Where is this Man at present?\\n\\nSECOND NAZARENE\\n\\nHe is in every place, my lord, but it is hard to find Him.\\n\\nFIRST NAZARENE\\n\\nIt is said that He is now in Samaria.\\n\\nA JEW\\n\\nIt is easy to see that this is not Messias, if He is in Samaria.\\nIt is not to the Samaritans that Messias shall come. The\\nSamaritans are accursed. They bring no offerings to the Temple.\\n\\nSECOND NAZARENE\\n\\nHe left Samaria a few days since. I think that at the present\\nmoment He is in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem.\\n\\nFIRST NAZARENE\\n\\nNo; He is not there. I have just come from Jerusalem. For two\\nmonths they have had no tidings of Him.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nNo matter! But let them find Him, and tell Him from me, I will\\nnot allow him to raise the dead! To change water into wine, to\\nheal the lepers and the blind.... He may do these things if He\\nwill. I say nothing against these things. In truth I hold it a\\ngood deed to heal a leper. But I allow no man to raise the dead.\\nIt would be terrible if the dead came back.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE STOMACH DANCE]\\n\\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\\n\\nAh! the wanton! The harlot! Ah! the daughter of Babylon with her\\ngolden eyes and her gilded eyelids!--Thus saith the Lord God, Let\\nthere come up against her a multitude of men. Let the people take\\nstones and stone her....\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nCommand him to be silent.\\n\\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\\n\\nLet the war captains pierce her with their swords, let them crush\\nher beneath their shields.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nNay, but it is infamous.\\n\\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\\n\\nIt is thus that I will wipe out all wickedness from the earth,\\nand that all women shall learn not to imitate her abominations.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nYou hear what he says against me? You allow him to revile your\\nwife?\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nHe did not speak your name.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nWhat does that matter? You know well that it is I whom he seeks\\nto revile. And I am your wife, am I not?\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nOf a truth, dear and noble Herodias, you are my wife, and before\\nthat you were the wife of my brother.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nIt was you who tore me from his arms.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nOf a truth I was stronger.... But let us not talk of that matter.\\nI do not desire to talk of it. It is the cause of the terrible\\nwords that the prophet has spoken. Peradventure on account of it\\na misfortune will come. Let us not speak of this matter. Noble\\nHerodias, we are not mindful of our guests. Fill thou my cup, my\\nwell-beloved. Fill with wine the great goblets of silver, and the\\ngreat goblets of glass. I will drink to C√¶sar. There are Romans\\nhere, we must drink to C√¶sar.\\n\\nALL\\n\\nC√¶sar! C√¶sar!\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nDo you not see your daughter, how pale she is?\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nWhat is it to you if she be pale or not?\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nNever have I seen her so pale.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nYou must not look at her.\\n\\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\\n\\nIn that day the sun shall become black like sackcloth of hair,\\nand the moon shall become like blood, and the stars of the\\nheavens shall fall upon the earth like ripe figs that fall from\\nthe fig-tree, and the kings of the earth shall be afraid.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nAh! Ah! I should like to see that day of which he speaks, when\\nthe moon shall become like blood, and when the stars shall fall\\nupon the earth like ripe figs. This prophet talks like a drunken\\nman ... but I cannot suffer the sound of his voice. I hate his\\nvoice. Command him to be silent.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI will not. I cannot understand what it is that he saith, but it\\nmay be an omen.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nI do not believe in omens. He speaks like a drunken man.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nIt may be he is drunk with the wine of God.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nWhat wine is that, the wine of God? From what vineyards is it\\ngathered? In what wine-press may one find it?\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\n[_From this point he looks all the while at Salom√©._]\\n\\nTigellinus, when you were at Rome of late, did the Emperor speak\\nwith you: on the subject of...?\\n\\nTIGELLINUS\\n\\nOn what subject, sire?\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nOn what subject? Ah! I asked you a question, did I not? I have\\nforgotten what I would have asked you.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nYou are looking again at my daughter. You must not look at her. I\\nhave already said so.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nYou say nothing else.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nI say it again.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nAnd that restoration of the Temple about which they have talked\\nso much, will anything be done? They say the veil of the\\nSanctuary has disappeared, do they not?\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nIt was thyself didst steal it. Thou speakest at random. I will\\nnot stay here. Let us go within.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nDance for me, Salom√©.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nI will not have her dance.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI have no desire to dance, Tetrarch.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nSalom√©, daughter of Herodias, dance for me.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nLet her alone.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI command thee to dance, Salom√©.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI will not dance, Tetrarch.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\n[_Laughing_].\\n\\nYou see how she obeys you.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nWhat is it to me whether she dance or not? It is naught to me.\\nTo-night I am happy, I am exceeding happy. Never have I been so\\nhappy.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nThe Tetrarch has a sombre look. Has he not a sombre look?\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nYes, he has a sombre look.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nWherefore should I not be happy? C√¶sar, who is lord of the world,\\nwho is lord of all things, loves me well. He has just sent me\\nmost precious gifts. Also he has promised me to summon to Rome\\nthe King of Cappadocia, who is my enemy. It may be that at Rome\\nhe will crucify him, for he is able to do all things that he\\nwishes. Verily, C√¶sar is lord. Thus you see I have a right to be\\nhappy. Indeed, I am happy. I have never been so happy. There is\\nnothing in the world that can mar my happiness.\\n\\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\\n\\nHe shall be seated on this throne. He shall be clothed in scarlet\\nand purple. In his hand he shall bear a golden cup full of his\\nblasphemies. And the angel of the Lord shall smite him. He shall\\nbe eaten of worms.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nYou hear what he says about you. He says that you will be eaten\\nof worms.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nIt is not of me that he speaks. He speaks never against me. It is\\nof the King of Cappadocia that he speaks; the King of Cappadocia,\\nwho is mine enemy. It is he who shall be eaten of worms. It is\\nnot I. Never has he spoken word against me, this prophet, save\\nthat I sinned in taking to wife the wife of my brother. It may be\\nhe is right. For, of a truth, you are sterile.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nI am sterile, I? You say that, you that are ever looking at my\\ndaughter, you that would have her dance for your pleasure? It is\\nabsurd to say that. I have borne a child. You have gotten no\\nchild, no, not even from one of your slaves. It is you who are\\nsterile, not I.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nPeace, woman! I say that you are sterile. You have borne me no\\nchild, and the prophet says that our marriage is not a true\\nmarriage. He says that it is an incestuous marriage, a marriage\\nthat will bring evils.... I fear he is right; I am sure that he\\nis right. But it is not the moment to speak of such things. I\\nwould be happy at this moment. Of a truth, I am happy. There is\\nnothing I lack.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nI am glad you are of so fair a humour to-night. It is not your\\ncustom. But it is late. Let us go within. Do not forget that we\\nhunt at sunrise. All honours must be shown to C√¶sar\\'s\\nambassadors, must they not?\\n\\nSECOND SOLDIER\\n\\nWhat a sombre look the Tetrarch wears.\\n\\nFIRST SOLDIER\\n\\nYes, he wears a sombre look.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nSalom√©, Salom√©, dance for me. I pray thee dance for me. I am sad\\nto-night. Yes; I am passing sad to-night. When I came hither I\\nslipped in blood, which is an evil omen; and I heard, I am sure I\\nheard in the air a beating of wings, a beating of giant wings. I\\ncannot tell what they mean ... I am sad to-night. Therefore dance\\nfor me. Dance for me, Salom√©, I beseech you. If you dance for me\\nyou may ask of me what you will, and I will give it you, even\\nunto the half of my kingdom.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE TOILETTE OF SALOM√â--I]\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\n[_Rising._] Will you indeed give me whatsoever I shall ask,\\nTetrarch?\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nDo not dance, my daughter.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nEverything, even the half of my kingdom.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nYou swear it, Tetrarch?\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI swear it, Salom√©.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nDo not dance, my daughter.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nBy what will you swear, Tetrarch?\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nBy my life, by my crown, by my gods. Whatsoever you desire I will\\ngive it you, even to the half of my kingdom, if you will but\\ndance for me. O, Salom√©, Salom√©, dance for me!\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nYou have sworn, Tetrarch.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI have sworn, Salom√©.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nAll this I ask, even the half of your kingdom.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nMy daughter, do not dance.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nEven to the half of my kingdom. Thou wilt be passing fair as a\\nqueen, Salom√©, if it please thee to ask for the half of my\\nkingdom. Will she not be fair as a queen? Ah! it is cold here!\\nThere is an icy wind, and I hear ... wherefore do I hear in the\\nair this beating of wings? Ah! one might fancy a bird, a huge\\nblack bird that hovers over the terrace. Why can I not see it,\\nthis bird? The beat of its wings is terrible. The breath of the\\nwind of its wings is terrible. It is a chill wind. Nay, but it is\\nnot cold, it is hot. I am choking. Pour water on my hands. Give\\nme snow to eat. Loosen my mantle. Quick! quick! loosen my mantle.\\nNay, but leave it. It is my garland that hurts me, my garland of\\nroses. The flowers are like fire. They have burned my forehead.\\n[_He tears the wreath from his head and throws it on the table._]\\nAh! I can breathe now. How red those petals are! They are like\\nstains of blood on the cloth. That does not matter. You must not\\nfind symbols in everything you see. It makes life impossible. It\\nwere better to say that stains of blood are as lovely as rose\\npetals. It were better far to say that.... But we will not speak\\nof this. Now I am happy, I am passing happy. Have I not the\\nright to be happy? Your daughter is going to dance for me. Will\\nyou not dance for me, Salom√©? You have promised to dance for me.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE TOILETTE OF SALOM√â--II]\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nI will not have her dance.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI will dance for you, Tetrarch.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nYou hear what your daughter says. She is going to dance for me.\\nYou do well to dance for me, Salom√©. And when you have danced for\\nme, forget not to ask of me whatsoever you wish. Whatsoever you\\nwish I will give it you, even to the half of my kingdom. I have\\nsworn it, have I not?\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nYou have sworn it, Tetrarch.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nAnd I have never broken my word. I am not of those who break\\ntheir oaths. I know not how to lie. I am the slave of my word,\\nand my word is the word of a king. The King of Cappadocia always\\nlies, but he is no true king. He is a coward. Also he owes me\\nmoney that he will not repay. He has even insulted my\\nambassadors. He has spoken words that were wounding. But C√¶sar\\nwill crucify him when he comes to Rome. I am sure that C√¶sar will\\ncrucify him. And if not, yet will he die, being eaten of worms.\\nThe prophet has prophesied it. Well! wherefore dost thou tarry,\\nSalom√©?\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI am awaiting until my slaves bring perfumes to me and the seven\\nveils, and take off my sandals. [_Slaves bring perfumes and the\\nseven veils, and take off the sandals of Salom√©._]\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nAh, you are going to dance with naked feet. \\'Tis well!--\\'Tis\\nwell. Your little feet will be like white doves. They will be\\nlike little white flowers that dance upon the trees.... No, no,\\nshe is going to dance on blood. There is blood spilt on the\\nground. She must not dance on blood. It were an evil omen.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nWhat is it to you if she dance on blood? Thou hast waded deep\\nenough therein....\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nWhat is it to me? Ah! look at the moon! She has become red. She\\nhas become red as blood. Ah! the prophet prophesied truly. He\\nprophesied that the moon would become red as blood. Did he not\\nprophesy it? All of you heard him. And now the moon has become\\nred as blood. Do ye not see it?\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nOh, yes, I see it well, and the stars are falling like ripe figs,\\nare they not? and the sun is becoming black like sackcloth of\\nhair, and the kings of the earth are afraid. That at least one\\ncan see. The prophet, for once in his life, was right, the kings\\nof the earth are afraid.... Let us go within. You are sick. They\\nwill say at Rome that you are mad. Let us go within, I tell you.\\n\\nTHE VOICE OF JOKANAAN\\n\\nWho is this who cometh from Edom, who is this who cometh from\\nBozra, whose raiment is dyed with purple, who shineth in the\\nbeauty of his garments, who walketh mighty in his greatness?\\nWherefore is thy raiment stained with scarlet?\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nLet us go within. The voice of that man maddens me. I will not\\nhave my daughter dance while he is continually crying out. I will\\nnot have her dance while you look at her in this fashion. In a\\nword, I will not have her dance.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nDo not rise, my wife, my queen, it will avail thee nothing. I\\nwill not go within till she hath danced. Dance, Salom√©, dance for\\nme.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nDo not dance, my daughter.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI am ready, Tetrarch.\\n\\n[_Salom√© dances the dance of the seven veils._]\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nAh! wonderful! wonderful! You see that she has danced for me,\\nyour daughter. Come near, Salom√©, come near, that I may give you\\nyour reward. Ah! I pay the dancers well. I will pay thee royally.\\nI will give thee whatsoever thy soul desireth. What wouldst thou\\nhave? Speak.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\n[_Kneeling_].\\n\\nI would that they presently bring me in a silver charger....\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\n[Laughing.]\\n\\nIn a silver charger? Surely yes, in a silver charger. She is\\ncharming, is she not? What is it you would have in a silver\\ncharger, O sweet and fair Salom√©, you who are fairer than all the\\ndaughters of Jud√¶a? What would you have them bring thee in a\\nsilver charger? Tell me. Whatsoever it may be, they shall give it\\nyou. My treasures belong to thee. What is it, Salom√©?\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\n[_Rising_].\\n\\nThe head of Jokanaan.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nAh! that is well said, my daughter.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nNo, no!\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nThat is well said, my daughter.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nNo, no, Salom√©. You do not ask me that. Do not listen to your\\nmother\\'s voice. She is ever giving you evil counsel. Do not heed\\nher.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI do not heed my mother. It is for mine own pleasure that I ask\\nthe head of Jokanaan in a silver charger. You hath sworn, Herod.\\nForget not that you have sworn an oath.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI know it. I have sworn by my gods. I know it well. But I pray\\nyou, Salom√©, ask of me something else. Ask of me the half of my\\nkingdom, and I will give it you. But ask not of me what you have\\nasked.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI ask of you the head of Jokanaan.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nNo, no, I do not wish it.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nYou have sworn, Herod.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nYes, you have sworn. Everybody heard you. You swore it before\\neverybody.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nBe silent! It is not to you I speak.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nMy daughter has done well to ask the head of Jokanaan. He has\\ncovered me with insults. He has said monstrous things against me.\\nOne can see that she loves her mother well. Do not yield, my\\ndaughter. He has sworn, he has sworn.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nBe silent, speak not to me!... Come, Salom√©, be reasonable. I\\nhave never been hard to you. I have ever loved you.... It may be\\nthat I have loved you too much. Therefore ask not this thing of\\nme. This is a terrible thing, an awful thing to ask of me.\\nSurely, I think thou art jesting. The head of a man that is cut\\nfrom his body is ill to look upon, is it not? It is not meet\\nthat the eyes of a virgin should look upon such a thing. What\\npleasure could you have in it? None. No, no, it is not what you\\ndesire. Hearken to me. I have an emerald, a great round emerald,\\nwhich C√¶sar\\'s minion sent me. If you look through this emerald\\nyou can see things which happen at a great distance. C√¶sar\\nhimself carries such an emerald when he goes to the circus. But\\nmy emerald is larger. I know well that it is larger. It is the\\nlargest emerald in the whole world. You would like that, would\\nyou not? Ask it of me and I will give it you.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE DANCER\\'S REWARD]\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nI demand the head of Jokanaan.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nYou are not listening. You are not listening. Suffer me to speak,\\nSalom√©.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nThe head of Jokanaan.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nNo, no, you would not have that. You say that to trouble me,\\nbecause I have looked at you all this evening. It is true, I have\\nlooked at you all this evening. Your beauty troubled me. Your\\nbeauty has grievously troubled me, and I have looked at you too\\nmuch. But I will look at you no more. Neither at things, nor at\\npeople should one look. Only in mirrors should one look, for\\nmirrors do but show us masks. Oh! oh! bring wine! I thirst....\\nSalom√©, Salom√©, let us be friends. Come now!... Ah! what would I\\nsay? What was\\'t? Ah! I remember!... Salom√©--nay, but come nearer\\nto me; I fear you will not hear me--Salom√©, you know my white\\npeacocks, my beautiful white peacocks, that walk in the garden\\nbetween the myrtles and the tall cypress trees. Their beaks are\\ngilded with gold, and the grains that they eat are gilded with\\ngold also, and their feet are stained with purple. When they cry\\nout the rain comes, and the moon shows herself in the heavens\\nwhen they spread their tails. Two by two they walk between the\\ncypress trees and the black myrtles, and each has a slave to tend\\nit. Sometimes they fly across the trees, and anon they crouch in\\nthe grass, and round the lake. There are not in all the world\\nbirds so wonderful. There is no king in all the world who\\npossesses such wonderful birds. I am sure that C√¶sar himself has\\nno birds so fair as my birds. I will give you fifty of my\\npeacocks. They will follow you whithersoever you go, and in the\\nmidst of them you will be like the moon in the midst of a great\\nwhite cloud.... I will give them all to you. I have but a\\nhundred, and in the whole world there is no king who has peacocks\\nlike unto my peacocks. But I will give them all to you. Only you\\nmust loose me from my oath, and must not ask of me that which you\\nhave asked of me.\\n\\n                        [_He empties the cup of wine._]\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nGive me the head of Jokanaan.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nWell said, my daughter! As for you, you are ridiculous with your\\npeacocks.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nBe silent! You cry out always; you cry out like a beast of prey.\\nYou must not. Your voice wearies me. Be silent, I say Salom√©,\\nthink of what you are doing. This man comes perchance from God.\\nHe is a holy man. The finger of God has touched him. God has put\\ninto his mouth terrible words. In the palace as in the desert God\\nis always with him.... At least it is possible. One does not\\nknow. It is possible that God is for him and with him.\\nFurthermore, if he died some misfortune might happen to me. In\\nany case, he said that the day he dies a misfortune will happen\\nto some one. That could only be to me. Remember, I slipped in\\nblood when I entered. Also, I heard a beating of wings in the\\nair, a beating of mighty wings. These are very evil omens, and\\nthere were others. I am sure there were others though I did not\\nsee them. Well, Salom√©, you do not wish a misfortune to happen to\\nme? You do not wish that. Listen to me, then.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nGive me the head of Jokanaan.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nAh! you are not listening to me. Be calm. I--I am calm. I am\\nquite calm. Listen. I have jewels hidden in this place--jewels\\nthat your mother even has never seen; jewels that are marvellous.\\nI have a collar of pearls, set in four rows. They are like unto\\nmoons chained with rays of silver. They are like fifty moons\\ncaught in a golden net. On the ivory of her breast a queen has\\nworn it. Thou shalt be as fair as a queen when thou wearest it. I\\nhave amethysts of two kinds, one that is black like wine, and one\\nthat is red like wine which has been coloured with water. I have\\ntopazes, yellow as are the eyes of tigers, and topazes that are\\npink as the eyes of a wood-pigeon, and green topazes that are as\\nthe eyes of cats. I have opals that burn always, with an icelike\\nflame, opals that make sad men\\'s minds, and are fearful of the\\nshadows. I have onyxes like the eyeballs of a dead woman. I have\\nmoonstones that change when the moon changes, and are wan when\\nthey see the sun. I have sapphires big like eggs, and as blue as\\nblue flowers. The sea wanders within them and the moon comes\\nnever to trouble the blue of their waves. I have chrysolites and\\nberyls and chrysoprases and rubies. I have sardonyx and hyacinth\\nstones, and stones of chalcedony, and I will give them all to\\nyou, all, and other things will I add to them. The King of the\\nIndies has but even now sent me four fans fashioned from the\\nfeathers of parrots, and the King of Numidia a garment of ostrich\\nfeathers. I have a crystal, into which it is not lawful for a\\nwoman to look, nor may young men behold it until they have been\\nbeaten with rods. In a coffer of nacre I have three wondrous\\nturquoises. He who wears them on his forehead can imagine things\\nwhich are not, and he who carries them in his hand can make women\\nsterile. These are great treasures above all price. They are\\ntreasures without price. But this is not all. In an ebony coffer\\nI have two cups of amber, that are like apples of gold. If an\\nenemy pour poison into these cups, they become like an apple of\\nsilver. In a coffer incrusted with amber I have sandals incrusted\\nwith glass. I have mantles that have been brought from the land\\nof the Seres, and bracelets decked about with carbuncles and with\\njade that come from the city of Euphrates.... What desirest thou\\nmore than this, Salom√©? Tell me the thing that thou desirest, and\\nI will give it thee. All that thou askest I will give thee, save\\none thing. I will give thee all that is mine, save one life. I\\nwill give thee the mantle of the high priest. I will give thee\\nthe veil of the sanctuary.\\n\\nTHE JEWS\\n\\nOh! oh!\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\nGive me the head of Jokanaan.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\n[_Sinking back in his seat_]. Let her be given what she asks! Of\\na truth she is her mother\\'s child! [_The first Soldier\\napproaches. Herodias draws from the hand of the Tetrarch the ring\\nof death and gives it to the Soldier, who straightway bears it to\\nthe Executioner. The Executioner looks scared._] Who has taken my\\nring? There was a ring on my right hand. Who has drunk my wine?\\nThere was wine in my cup. It was full of wine. Someone has drunk\\nit! Oh! surely some evil will befall some one. [_The Executioner\\ngoes down into the cistern._] Ah! Wherefore did I give my oath?\\nKings ought never to pledge their word. If they keep it not, it\\nis terrible, and if they keep it, it is terrible also.\\n\\nHERODIAS\\n\\nMy daughter has done well.\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nI am sure that some misfortune will happen.\\n\\nSALOM√â\\n\\n[_She leans over the cistern and listens._]\\n\\nThere is no sound. I hear nothing. Why does he not cry out, this\\nman? Ah! if any man sought to kill me, I would cry out, I would\\nstruggle, I would not suffer.... Strike, strike, Naaman, strike,\\nI tell you.... No, I hear nothing. There is a silence, a terrible\\nsilence. Ah! something has fallen upon the ground. I heard\\nsomething fall. It is the sword of the headsman. He is afraid,\\nthis slave. He has let his sword fall. He dare not kill him. He\\nis a coward, this slave! Let soldiers be sent. [_She sees the\\nPage of Herodias and addresses him._] Come hither, thou wert the\\nfriend of him who is dead, is it not so? Well, I tell thee, there\\nare not dead men enough. Go to the soldiers and bid them go down\\nand bring me the thing I ask, the thing the Tetrarch has promised\\nme, the thing that is mine. [_The Page recoils. She turns to the\\nsoldiers._] Hither, ye soldiers. Get ye down into this cistern\\nand bring me the head of this man. [_The Soldiers recoil._]\\nTetrarch, Tetrarch, command your soldiers that they bring me the\\nhead of Jokanaan.\\n\\n[_A huge black arm, the arm of the Executioner, comes forth from\\nthe cistern, bearing on a silver shield the head of Jokanaan.\\nSalom√© seizes it. Herod hides his face with his cloak. Herodias\\nsmiles and fans herself. The Nazarenes fall on their knees and\\nbegin to pray._]\\n\\nAh! thou wouldst not suffer me to kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan. Well!\\nI will kiss it now. I will bite it with my teeth as one bites a\\nripe fruit. Yes, I will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan. I said it; did\\nI not say it? I said it. Ah! I will kiss it now.... But,\\nwherefore dost thou not look at me, Jokanaan? Thine eyes that\\nwere so terrible, so full of rage and scorn, are shut now.\\nWherefore are they shut? Open thine eyes! Lift up thine eyelids,\\nJokanaan! Wherefore dost thou not look at me? Art thou afraid of\\nme, Jokanaan, that thou wilt not look at me?... And thy tongue,\\nthat was like a red snake darting poison, it moves no more, it\\nsays nothing now, Jokanaan, that scarlet viper that spat its\\nvenom upon me. It is strange, is it not? How is it that the red\\nviper stirs no longer?... Thou wouldst have none of me, Jokanaan.\\nThou didst reject me. Thou didst speak evil words against me.\\nThou didst treat me as a harlot, as a wanton, me, Salom√©,\\ndaughter of Herodias, Princess of Jud√¶a! Well, Jokanaan, I still\\nlive, but thou, thou art dead, and thy head belongs to me. I can\\ndo with it what I will. I can throw it to the dogs and to the\\nbirds of the air. That which the dogs leave, the birds of the air\\nshall devour.... Ah, Jokanaan, Jokanaan, thou wert the only man\\nthat I have loved. All other men are hateful to me. But thou,\\nthou wert beautiful! Thy body was a column of ivory set on a\\nsilver socket. It was a garden full of doves and of silver\\nlilies. It was a tower of silver decked with shields of ivory.\\nThere was nothing in the world so white as thy body. There was\\nnothing in the world so black as thy hair. In the whole world\\nthere was nothing so red as thy mouth. Thy voice was a censer\\nthat scattered strange perfumes, and when I looked on thee I\\nheard a strange music. Ah! wherefore didst thou not look at me,\\nJokanaan? Behind thine hands and thy curses thou didst hide thy\\nface. Thou didst put upon thine eyes the covering of him who\\nwould see his God. Well, thou hast seen thy God, Jokanaan, but\\nme, me, thou didst never see. If thou hadst seen me thou wouldst\\nhave loved me. I, I saw thee, Jokanaan, and I loved thee. Oh, how\\nI loved thee! I love thee yet, Jokanaan, I love thee only.... I\\nam athirst for thy beauty; I am hungry for thy body; and neither\\nwine nor fruits can appease my desire. What shall I do now,\\nJokanaan? Neither the floods nor the great waters can quench my\\npassion. I was a princess, and thou didst scorn me. I was a\\nvirgin, and thou didst take my virginity from me. I was chaste,\\nand thou didst fill my veins with fire.... Ah! ah! wherefore\\ndidst thou not look at me, Jokanaan? If thou hadst looked at me\\nthou hadst loved me. Well I know that thou wouldst have loved me,\\nand the mystery of love is greater than the mystery of death.\\nLove only should one consider.\\n\\n[Illustration: THE CLIMAX]\\n\\nHEROD\\n\\nShe is monstrous, thy daughter, she is altogether monstrous.

Interest in the √Üsthetic\\nSchool, of which he was already the acknowledged master, had sometime\\npreviously spread to the United States, and it is said that the\\nproduction of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera, ‚ÄúPatience,‚Äù[1] in which he\\nand his disciples were held up to ridicule, determined him to pay a\\nvisit to the States to give some lectures explaining what he meant by\\n√Üstheticism, hoping thereby to interest, and possibly to instruct and\\nelevate our transatlantic cousins.\\n\\nHe set sail on board the ‚ÄúArizona‚Äù on Saturday, December 24th, 1881,\\narriving in New York early in the following year. On landing he was\\nbombarded by journalists eager to interview the distinguished stranger.\\n‚ÄúPunch,‚Äù in its issue of January 14th, in a happy vein, parodied these\\ninterviewers, the most amusing passage in which referred to ‚ÄúHis\\nGlorious Past,‚Äù wherein Wilde was made to say, ‚ÄúPrecisely--I took the\\nNewdigate. Oh! no doubt, every year some man gets the Newdigate; but not\\nevery year does Newdigate get an Oscar.‚Äù\\n\\nAt Omaha, where, under the auspices of the Social Art Club, Wilde\\ndelivered a lecture on ‚ÄúDecorative Art,‚Äù he described his impressions\\nof many American houses as being ‚Äúilly designed, decorated shabbily, and\\nin bad taste, filled with furniture that was not honestly made, and was\\nout of character.‚Äù This statement gave rise to the following verses:--\\n\\n    What a shame and what a pity,\\n    In the streets of London City\\n      Mr. Wilde is seen no more.\\n    Far from Piccadilly banished,\\n    He to Omaha has vanished.\\n      Horrid place, which swells ignore.\\n\\n    On his back a coat he beareth,\\n    Such as Sir John Bennet weareth,\\n      Made of velvet--strange array!\\n    Legs Apollo might have sighed for,\\n    Or great Hercules have died for,\\n      His knee breeches now display.\\n\\n    Waving sunflower and lily,\\n    He calls all the houses ‚Äúilly\\n      Decorated and designed.‚Äù\\n    For of taste they‚Äôve not a tittle;\\n    They may chew and they may whittle;\\n      But they‚Äôre all born colour-blind!\\n\\nHis lectures dealt almost exclusively with the subjects of Art and Dress\\nReform. In the course of one lecture he remarked that the most\\nimpressive room he had yet entered in America was the one in Camden Town\\nwhere he met Walt Whitman. It contained plenty of fresh air and\\nsunlight. On the table was a simple cruse of water. This led to a\\nparody, in the style of Whitman, describing an imaginary interview\\nbetween the two poets, which appeared in ‚ÄúThe Century‚Äù a few months\\nlater. Wilde is called Narcissus and Whitman Paumanokides.\\n\\n  Paumanokides:--\\n\\n      Who may this be?\\n    This young man clad unusually with loose locks, languorous,\\n          glidingly toward me advancing,\\n    Toward the ceiling of my chamber his orbic and expressive eyeballs\\n          uprolling,\\n\\nand so on, to which Narcissus replies,\\n\\n    O clarion, from whose brazen throat,\\n      Strange sounds across the seas are blown,\\n    Where England, girt as with a moat,\\n      A strong sea-lion sits alone!\\n\\nOf the lectures which he delivered in America only one has been\\npreserved, namely that on the English Renaissance. This was his first\\nlecture, and it was delivered in New York on January 9th, 1882.\\nAccording to a contemporary account in the ‚ÄúNew York Herald‚Äù a\\ndistinguished and crowded audience assembled in Chickering Hall that\\nevening to listen to one who ‚Äúwas well worth seeing, his short breeches\\nand silk stockings showing to even better advantage upon the stage than\\nin the gilded drawing-rooms, where the young Apostle has heretofore been\\nseen in New York.‚Äù[2]\\n\\nOn leaving the States in the ‚Äúfall‚Äù of the year Wilde proceeded to\\nCanada and thence to Nova Scotia, arriving in Halifax in the second week\\nof October. Of his visit there we have no record except an amusing\\ninterview described in a local paper a few days later. He was dressed in\\na velvet jacket with an ordinary linen collar and neck tie and he wore\\ntrousers. ‚ÄúMr. Wilde,‚Äù the interviewer states, ‚Äúwas communicative and\\ngenial; he said he found Canada pleasant, but in answer to a question as\\nto whether European or American women were the more beautiful, he\\ndexterously evaded his querist.‚Äù\\n\\nAs regards poetry he expressed his opinion that Poe was the greatest\\nAmerican poet, and that Walt Whitman, if not a poet, was a man who\\nsounded a strong note, perhaps neither prose nor poetry, but something\\nof his own that was ‚Äúgrand, original and unique.‚Äù\\n\\nDuring his tour in America Wilde ‚Äúhappened to find‚Äù himself (as he has\\nhimself described it), in Louisville, Kentucky. The subject he had\\nselected to speak on was the Mission of Art in the Nineteenth Century.\\nIn the course of his lecture he had occasion to quote Keats‚Äô Sonnet on\\nBlue ‚Äúas an example of the poet‚Äôs delicate sense of colour-harmonies.‚Äù\\nAfter the lecture there came round to see him ‚Äúa lady of middle age,\\nwith a sweet gentle manner and most musical voice,‚Äù who introduced\\nherself as Mrs. Speed, the daughter of George Keats, and she invited the\\nlecturer to come and examine the Keats manuscripts in her possession.\\n\\nSome months afterwards when lecturing in California he received a letter\\nfrom this lady asking him to accept the original manuscript of the\\nsonnet which he had quoted.\\n\\nMention must be made of Wilde‚Äôs first play, a drama in blank verse\\nentitled ‚ÄúVera, or the Nihilists.‚Äù It had been arranged that, before his\\ndeparture for America, this play should be performed at the Adelphi\\nTheatre, London, with Mrs. Bernard Beere as the heroine, on Saturday,\\nDecember 17th, 1881, but a few weeks before the date fixed for the first\\nperformance, the author decided to postpone the production ‚Äúowing to the\\nstate of political feeling in England.‚Äù\\n\\nOn his return to England in 1883 Wilde started on a lecturing tour, the\\nfirst being to the Art Students of the Royal Academy at their Club in\\nGolden Square on June 30th. Ten days later he spoke at Prince‚Äôs Hall on\\nhis ‚ÄúPersonal Impressions of America,‚Äù and on subsequent occasions at\\nMargate, Ramsgate and Southampton. On Monday, July 30th he lectured at\\nSouthport and on the following Thursday he went to Liverpool to welcome\\nMrs. Langtry on her return from America, and the same afternoon he left\\non his second visit to the States in order to superintend the rehearsals\\nof ‚ÄúVera,‚Äù which it had been arranged to produce at the Union Square\\nTheatre, New York, on August 20th following. The piece was not a\\nsuccess--it was, indeed, the only failure Wilde had. However, his next\\nplay, which he called his ‚ÄúOpus Secundum,‚Äù also a blank verse tragedy,\\nhad a successful run in America in 1891. This was ‚ÄúThe Duchess of\\nPadua,‚Äù played by Lawrence Barrett, under the title of ‚ÄúGuido Ferranti.‚Äù\\nThis has not been seen in England, nor is it even possible for Wilde‚Äôs\\nadmirers to read this early offspring of his pen, for only twenty copies\\nwere printed for acting purposes in America and of these but one is\\nknown to be in existence, in this country at least.\\n\\nAn authorised German translation was made by Max Meyerfeld and the first\\nperformance took place at the German Theatre in Hamburg about a year\\nago. An English version is advertised from a piratical publisher in\\nParis but it is only a translation from the German back into English.\\n\\nTowards the end of September 1883 Oscar Wilde returned to England and\\nimmediately began ‚Äúan all round lecturing tour,‚Äù his first visit being\\nto Wandsworth Town Hall on Monday, September 24th, when he delivered to\\nan enthusiastic audience a lecture on his ‚ÄúImpressions of America,‚Äù\\nwhich is contained in the following pages. He was dressed, a London\\npaper of the time states, ‚Äúin ordinary evening costume, and carried an\\norange-coloured silk handkerchief in his breast. He spoke with great\\nfluency, in a voice now and then singularly musical, and only once or\\ntwice made a scarcely perceptible reference to notes.‚Äù The lecture was\\nunder the auspices of a local Literary Society, and the principle\\nresidents of the district turned out ‚Äúen masse.‚Äù The Chairman, the Rev.\\nJohn Park, in introducing the lecturer, said there were two reasons why\\nhe was glad to welcome him, and he thought his own feelings would be\\nshared by the audience. They must all plead guilty to a feeling of\\ncuriosity, he hoped a laudable one, to see and hear Mr. Wilde for his\\nown sake, and they were also glad to hear about America--a country which\\nmany might regard as a kind of Elysium.\\n\\nOn March 5th in the following year Wilde lectured at the Crystal Palace\\non his American experiences, and on April 26th he ‚Äúpreached his Gospel\\nin the East-end,‚Äù when it is recorded that his audience was not only\\ndelighted with his humour, but was ‚Äúsurprised at the excellent good\\nsense he talked.‚Äù His subject was a plea in favour of ‚Äúart for schools,‚Äù\\nand many of his remarks about the English system of elementary\\neducation--with its insistence on ‚Äúthe population of places that no one\\never wants to go to,‚Äù and its ‚Äúfamiliarity with the lives of persons who\\nprobably never existed‚Äù--were said to be quite worthy of Ruskin. A\\ncontemporary account adds that Wilde ‚Äúshowed himself a pupil of Mr.\\nRuskin‚Äôs, too, in insisting on the importance of every child being\\ntaught some handicraft, and in looking forward to the time when a boy\\nwould rather look at a bird or even draw it than throw ‚Äúhis customary\\nstone!‚Äù\\n\\nThe British ‚Äúgamin‚Äù has not made much progress in this respect during\\nthe last twenty years!\\n\\nHis lectures on ‚ÄúDress,‚Äù with the newspaper correspondence which they\\nevoked, including some of Oscar Wilde‚Äôs replies in his most\\ncharacteristic vein, must be reserved for a future volume.\\n\\n          STUART MASON.\\n\\n  Oxford, January 1906.\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES.\\n\\n[1] First produced at the Opera Comique, April 23rd, 1881. Wilde was\\nburlesqued as Reginald Bunthorne, a Fleshly Poet.\\n\\n[2] Wilde repeated this lecture throughout the States during his tour.\\nAt Rochester, on February 7th, he met with a most disorderly reception\\non the part of the College Students. Two days later Mr. Joaquin Miller,\\nof St. Louis, wrote to Wilde saying that he had ‚Äúread with shame about\\nthe behaviour of those ruffians.‚Äù To this Wilde replied, ‚ÄúI thank you\\nfor your chivalrous and courteous letter,‚Äù and in the course of his\\nletter makes a more special attack on that critic whom he terms ‚Äúthe\\nitinerant libeller of New England.‚Äù\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIMPRESSIONS OF AMERICA.\\n\\n\\nI fear I cannot picture America as altogether an Elysium--perhaps, from\\nthe ordinary standpoint I know but little about the country. I cannot\\ngive its latitude or longitude; I cannot compute the value of its dry\\ngoods, and I have no very close acquaintance with its politics. These\\nare matters which may not interest you, and they certainly are not\\ninteresting to me.\\n\\nThe first thing that struck me on landing in America was that if the\\nAmericans are not the most well-dressed people in the world, they are\\nthe most comfortably dressed. Men are seen there with the dreadful\\nchimney-pot hat, but there are very few hatless men; men wear the\\nshocking swallow-tail coat, but few are to be seen with no coat at all.\\nThere is an air of comfort in the appearance of the people which is a\\nmarked contrast to that seen in this country, where, too often, people\\nare seen in close contact with rags.\\n\\nThe next thing particularly noticeable is that everybody seems in a\\nhurry to catch a train. This is a state of things which is not\\nfavourable to poetry or romance. Had Romeo or Juliet been in a constant\\nstate of anxiety about trains, or had their minds been agitated by the\\nquestion of return-tickets, Shakespeare could not have given us those\\nlovely balcony scenes which are so full of poetry and pathos.\\n\\nAmerica is the noisiest country that ever existed. One is waked up in\\nthe morning, not by the singing of the nightingale, but by the steam\\nwhistle. It is surprising that the sound practical sense of the\\nAmericans does not reduce this intolerable noise. All Art depends upon\\nexquisite and delicate sensibility, and such continual turmoil must\\nultimately be destructive of the musical faculty.\\n\\nThere is not so much beauty to be found in American cities as in Oxford,\\nCambridge, Salisbury or Winchester, where are lovely relics of a\\nbeautiful age; but still there is a good deal of beauty to be seen in\\nthem now and then, but only where the American has not attempted to\\ncreate it. Where the Americans have attempted to produce beauty they\\nhave signally failed. A remarkable characteristic of the Americans is\\nthe manner in which they have applied science to modern life.\\n\\nThis is apparent in the most cursory stroll through New York. In England\\nan inventor is regarded almost as a crazy man, and in too many instances\\ninvention ends in disappointment and poverty. In America an inventor is\\nhonoured, help is forthcoming, and the exercise of ingenuity, the\\napplication of science to the work of man, is there the shortest road to\\nwealth. There is no country in the world where machinery is so lovely as\\nin America.\\n\\nI have always wished to believe that the line of strength and the line\\nof beauty are one. That wish was realised when I contemplated American\\nmachinery. It was not until I had seen the water-works at Chicago that I\\nrealised the wonders of machinery; the rise and fall of the steel rods,\\nthe symmetrical motion of the great wheels is the most beautifully\\nrhythmic thing I have ever seen.[3] One is impressed in America, but not\\nfavourably impressed, by the inordinate size of everything. The country\\nseems to try to bully one into a belief in its power by its impressive\\nbigness.\\n\\nI was disappointed with Niagara--most people must be disappointed with\\nNiagara. Every American bride is taken there, and the sight of the\\nstupendous waterfall must be one of the earliest, if not the keenest,\\ndisappointments in American married life. One sees it under bad\\nconditions, very far away, the point of view not showing the splendour\\nof the water. To appreciate it really one has to see it from underneath\\nthe fall, and to do that it is necessary to be dressed in a yellow\\noil-skin, which is as ugly as a mackintosh--and I hope none of you ever\\nwears one. It is a consolation to know, however, that such an artist as\\nMadame Bernhardt has not only worn that yellow, ugly dress, but has been\\nphotographed in it.\\n\\nPerhaps the most beautiful part of America is the West, to reach which,\\nhowever, involves a journey by rail of six days, racing along tied to an\\nugly tin-kettle of a steam engine. I found but poor consolation for this\\njourney in the fact that the boys who infest the cars and sell\\neverything that one can eat--or should not eat--were selling editions of\\nmy poems vilely printed on a kind of grey blotting paper, for the low\\nprice of ten cents.[4] Calling these boys on one side I told them that\\nthough poets like to be popular they desire to be paid, and selling\\neditions of my poems without giving me a profit is dealing a blow at\\nliterature which must have a disastrous effect on poetical aspirants.\\nThe invariable reply that they made was that they themselves made a\\nprofit out of the transaction and that was all they cared about.\\n\\nIt is a popular superstition that in America a visitor is invariably\\naddressed as ‚ÄúStranger.‚Äù I was never once addressed as ‚ÄúStranger.‚Äù When\\nI went to Texas I was called ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äù; when I got to the centre of the\\ncountry I was addressed as ‚ÄúColonel,‚Äù and, on arriving at the borders of\\nMexico, as ‚ÄúGeneral.‚Äù On the whole, however, ‚ÄúSir,‚Äù the old English\\nmethod of addressing people is the most common.\\n\\nIt is, perhaps, worth while to note that what many people call\\nAmericanisms are really old English expressions which have lingered in\\nour colonies while they have been lost in our own country. Many people\\nimagine that the term ‚ÄúI guess,‚Äù which is so common in America, is\\npurely an American expression, but it was used by John Locke in his work\\non ‚ÄúThe Understanding,‚Äù just as we now use ‚ÄúI think.‚Äù[5]\\n\\nIt is in the colonies, and not in the mother country, that the old life\\nof the country really exists. If one wants to realise what English\\nPuritanism is--not at its worst (when it is very bad), but at its best,\\nand then it is not very good--I do not think one can find much of it in\\nEngland, but much can be found about Boston and Massachusetts. We have\\ngot rid of it. America still preserves it, to be, I hope, a short-lived\\ncuriosity.\\n\\nSan Francisco is a really beautiful city. China Town, peopled by Chinese\\nlabourers, is the most artistic town I have ever come across. The\\npeople--strange, melancholy Orientals, whom many people would call\\ncommon, and they are certainly very poor--have determined that they will\\nhave nothing about them that is not beautiful. In the Chinese\\nrestaurant, where these navvies meet to have supper in the evening, I\\nfound them drinking tea out of china cups as delicate as the petals of a\\nrose-leaf, whereas at the gaudy hotels I was supplied with a delf cup an\\ninch and a half thick. When the Chinese bill was presented it was made\\nout on rice paper, the account being done in Indian ink as fantastically\\nas if an artist had been etching little birds on a fan.\\n\\nSalt Lake City contains only two buildings of note, the chief being the\\nTabernacle, which is in the shape of a soup-kettle. It is decorated by\\nthe only native artist, and he has treated religious subjects in the\\nnaive spirit of the early Florentine painters, representing people of\\nour own day in the dress of the period side by side with people of\\nBiblical history who are clothed in some romantic costume.\\n\\nThe building next in importance is called the Amelia Palace, in honour\\nof one of Brigham Young‚Äôs wives. When he died the present president of\\nthe Mormons stood up in the Tabernacle and said that it had been\\nrevealed to him that he was to have the Amelia Palace, and that on this\\nsubject there were to be no more revelations of any kind!\\n\\nFrom Salt Lake City one travels over the great plains of Colorado and up\\nthe Rocky Mountains, on the top of which is Leadville, the richest city\\nin the world. It has also got the reputation of being the roughest, and\\nevery man carries a revolver. I was told that if I went there they\\nwould be sure to shoot me or my travelling manager. I wrote and told\\nthem that nothing that they could do to my travelling manager would\\nintimidate me. They are miners--men working in metals, so I lectured to\\nthem on the Ethics of Art. I read them passages from the autobiography\\nof Benvenuto Cellini and they seemed much delighted. I was reproved by\\nmy hearers for not having brought him with me. I explained that he had\\nbeen dead for some little time which elicited the enquiry ‚ÄúWho shot\\nhim‚Äù? They afterwards took me to a dancing saloon where I saw the only\\nrational method of art criticism I have ever come across. Over the piano\\nwas printed a notice:--\\n\\n    |                           |\\n  --+---------------------------+--\\n    |  PLEASE DO NOT SHOOT THE  |\\n    |          PIANIST.         |\\n    |    HE IS DOING HIS BEST.  |\\n  --+---------------------------+--\\n    |                           |\\n\\nThe mortality among pianists in that place is marvellous. Then they\\nasked me to supper, and having accepted, I had to descend a mine in a\\nrickety bucket in which it was impossible to be graceful. Having got\\ninto the heart of the mountain I had supper, the first course being\\nwhisky, the second whisky and the third whisky.\\n\\nI went to the Theatre to lecture and I was informed that just before I\\nwent there two men had been seized for committing a murder, and in that\\ntheatre they had been brought on to the stage at eight o‚Äôclock in the\\nevening, and then and there tried and executed before a crowded\\naudience. But I found these miners very charming and not at all rough.\\n\\nAmong the more elderly inhabitants of the South I found a melancholy\\ntendency to date every event of importance by the late war. ‚ÄúHow\\nbeautiful the moon is to-night,‚Äù I once remarked to a gentleman who was\\nstanding next to me. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù was his reply, ‚Äúbut you should have seen it\\nbefore the war.‚Äù\\n\\nSo infinitesimal did I find the knowledge of Art, west of the Rocky\\nMountains, that an art patron--one who in his day had been a\\nminer--actually sued the railroad company for damages because the\\nplaster cast of Venus of Milo, which he had imported from Paris, had\\nbeen delivered minus the arms. And, what is more surprising still, he\\ngained his case and the damages.\\n\\nPennsylvania, with its rocky gorges and woodland scenery, reminded me of\\nSwitzerland. The prairie reminded me of a piece of blotting-paper.\\n\\nThe Spanish and French have left behind them memorials in the beauty of\\ntheir names. All the cities that have beautiful names derive them from\\nthe Spanish or the French. The English people give intensely ugly names\\nto places. One place had such an ugly name that I refused to lecture\\nthere. It was called Grigsville. Supposing I had founded a school of Art\\nthere--fancy ‚ÄúEarly Grigsville.‚Äù Imagine a School of Art teaching\\n‚ÄúGrigsville Renaissance.‚Äù\\n\\nAs for slang I did not hear much of it, though a young lady who had\\nchanged her clothes after an afternoon dance did say that ‚Äúafter the\\nheel kick she shifted her day goods.‚Äù\\n\\nAmerican youths are pale and precocious, or sallow and supercilious, but\\nAmerican girls are pretty and charming--little oases of pretty\\nunreasonableness in a vast desert of practical common-sense.\\n\\nEvery American girl is entitled to have twelve young men devoted to her.\\nThey remain her slaves and she rules them with charming nonchalance.\\n\\nThe men are entirely given to business; they have, as they say, their\\nbrains in front of their heads. They are also exceedingly acceptive of\\nnew ideas. Their education is practical. We base the education of\\nchildren entirely on books, but we must give a child a mind before we\\ncan instruct the mind. Children have a natural antipathy to\\nbooks--handicraft should be the basis of education. Boys and girls\\nshould be taught to use their hands to make something, and they would be\\nless apt to destroy and be mischievous.\\n\\nIn going to America one learns that poverty is not a necessary\\naccompaniment to civilisation. There at any rate is a country that has\\nno trappings, no pageants and no gorgeous ceremonies. I saw only two\\nprocessions--one was the Fire Brigade preceded by the Police, the other\\nwas the Police preceded by the Fire Brigade.\\n\\nEvery man when he gets to the age of twenty-one is allowed a vote, and\\nthereby immediately acquires his political education. The Americans are\\nthe best politically educated people in the world. It is well worth\\none‚Äôs while to go to a country which can teach us the beauty of the word\\nFREEDOM and the value of the thing LIBERTY.\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES.\\n\\n[3] In a poem published in an American magazine on February 15th, 1882,\\nWilde wrote\\n\\n      ‚ÄúAnd in the throbbing engine room\\n    Leap the long rods of polished steel.‚Äù\\n\\n[4] _Poems by Oscar Wilde.

An immense wolf rug,\\nbordered with scarlet, was thrown over it and half-encircled his\\ngraceful form in its warm embrace. Wilde was wearied. In a languid, half\\nenervated manner he gently sipped hot chocolate from a cup by his side.\\nOccasionally he inhaled a long, deep whiff from a smouldering cigarette\\nheld lightly in his white and shapely hand.\\n\\n[Sidenote: His Dress.]\\n\\nHe was attired in a smoking suit of dark brown velvet faced with lapels\\nof red quilted silk. The ends of a long dark necktie floated over the\\nfacing like sea-weed on foam tinged by the dying sun. Dark brown nether\\ngarments, striped with red up the seam, and patent leather shoes with\\nlight cloth uppers completed the rest of the poet‚Äôs costume.\\n\\nHis favourite colour is said to have been something between brown and\\ngreen, a tint ‚Äúthat never was on sea or sky,‚Äù and he had a complete suit\\nmade of it. A white walking-stick which he was in the habit of carrying\\nwas presented to him at the Acropolis and was said to have been cut from\\nthe olive groves of the Academia. Only in the evening was he wont to don\\nknee breeches, ‚Äúbut evening and morning alike,‚Äù adds his interviewer,\\n‚Äúfind him neither more nor less than a man, and always a perfect\\ngentleman.‚Äù\\n\\n[Sidenote: His appearance.]\\n\\nLong masses of dark brown hair, parted in the middle, fell in odd curves\\nof beauty over his broad shoulders. He wore neither beard nor moustache.\\nThe full, rather sensuous lips, now pressed close together with\\nmomentary tension, now parted in kindly smile, showed to perfection the\\nnobility of his countenance.\\n\\nA Grecian nose and a well-tinged flush of health on the poet‚Äôs face\\nadded all that was required to make it a truly remarkable one. The eyes\\nwere large, dark[6] and ever-changing in expression. He was a charming\\ncompanion who could tell racy stories and repeat _bons mots_ of those\\nwhom society delighted to honour, and at the same time could cap\\nquotations from Greek authors.\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTE.\\n\\n[6] A French writer, M.

Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,\\nevery one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no\\ndoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville\\nhimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his\\nduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.\\n\\n\"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,\" said Lord\\nCanterville, \"since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was\\nfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two\\nskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for\\ndinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been\\nseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of\\nthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King\\'s\\nCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none\\nof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often\\ngot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises\\nthat came from the corridor and the library.\"\\n\\n\"My Lord,\" answered the Minister, \"I will take the furniture and the\\nghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have\\neverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows\\npainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors and\\nprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in\\nEurope, we\\'d have it at home in a very short time in one of our public\\nmuseums, or on the road as a show.\"\\n\\n\"I fear that the ghost exists,\" said Lord Canterville, smiling, \"though\\nit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It\\nhas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always\\nmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.\"\\n\\n\"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But\\nthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature\\nare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.\"\\n\\n\"You are certainly very natural in America,\" answered Lord Canterville,\\nwho did not quite understand Mr. Otis\\'s last observation, \"and if you\\ndon\\'t mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember\\nI warned you.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: MISS VIRGINIA E. OTIS]\\n\\nA few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of\\nthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.\\nMrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been\\na celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,\\nwith fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving\\ntheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the\\nimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had\\nnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a\\nreally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she\\nwas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we\\nhave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of\\ncourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents\\nin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a\\nfair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself\\nfor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for\\nthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an\\nexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.\\nOtherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little\\ngirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom\\nin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced\\nold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length\\nand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of\\nthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was\\nsent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.\\nAfter Virginia came the twins, who were usually called \"The Star and\\nStripes,\" as they were always getting swished. They were delightful\\nboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true\\nrepublicans of the family.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"HAD ONCE RACED OLD LORD BILTON ON HER PONY\"]\\n\\nAs Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway\\nstation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and\\nthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July\\nevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now\\nand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or\\nsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.\\nLittle squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,\\nand the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy\\nknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of\\nCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with\\nclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great\\nflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they\\nreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.\\n\\nStanding on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed\\nin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the\\nhousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville\\'s earnest request, had\\nconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a low\\ncurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,\\n\"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.\" Following her, they passed\\nthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled\\nin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Here\\nthey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,\\nthey sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.\\n\\nSuddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by\\nthe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said\\nto Mrs. Umney, \"I am afraid something has been spilt there.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, madam,\" replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, \"blood has\\nbeen spilt on that spot.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: \"BLOOD HAS BEEN SPILLED ON THAT SPOT\"]\\n\\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mrs. Otis; \"I don\\'t at all care for blood-stains in\\na sitting-room. It must be removed at once.\"\\n\\nThe old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,\\n\"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on\\nthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.\\nSir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very\\nmysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his\\nguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much\\nadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.\"\\n\\n\"That is all nonsense,\" cried Washington Otis; \"Pinkerton\\'s Champion\\nStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,\" and\\nbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon his\\nknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what\\nlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the\\nblood-stain could be seen.\\n\\n\"I knew Pinkerton would do it,\" he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he\\nlooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these\\nwords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a\\nfearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.\\nUmney fainted.\\n\\n\"What a monstrous climate!\" said the American Minister, calmly, as he\\nlit a long cheroot. \"I guess the old country is so overpopulated that\\nthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of\\nopinion that emigration is the only thing for England.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Hiram,\" cried Mrs. Otis, \"what can we do with a woman who\\nfaints?\"\\n\\n\"Charge it to her like breakages,\" answered the Minister; \"she won\\'t\\nfaint after that;\" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.\\nThere was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she\\nsternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.\\n\\n\"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,\" she said, \"that would make\\nany Christian\\'s hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not\\nclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.\" Mr.\\nOtis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they\\nwere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of\\nProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for\\nan increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\nThe storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note\\noccurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,\\nthey found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. \"I don\\'t\\nthink it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,\" said Washington,\\n\"for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.\" He\\naccordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning\\nit appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the\\nlibrary had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key\\ncarried up-stairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis\\nbegan to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the\\nexistence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the\\nPsychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs.\\nMyers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains\\nwhen connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective\\nexistence of phantasmata were removed for ever.\\n\\nThe day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the\\nwhole family went out to drive. They did not return home till nine\\no\\'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned\\nupon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of\\nreceptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of\\npsychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned\\nfrom Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of\\ncultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority\\nof Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress; the\\ndifficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in\\nthe best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of\\nthe world-soul; the advantages of the baggage-check system in railway\\ntravelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the\\nLondon drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was\\nSir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o\\'clock the\\nfamily retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time\\nafter, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside\\nhis room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming\\nnearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at\\nthe time. It was exactly one o\\'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his\\npulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,\\nand with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his\\nslippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened\\nthe door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man\\nof terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair\\nfell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of\\nantique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung\\nheavy manacles and rusty gyves.\\n\\n\"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Otis, \"I really must insist on your oiling those\\nchains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the\\nTammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious\\nupon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect\\non the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall\\nleave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to\\nsupply you with more, should you require it.\" With these words the\\nUnited States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and,\\nclosing his door, retired to rest.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"I REALLY MUST INSIST ON YOUR OILING THOSE CHAINS\"]\\n\\nFor a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural\\nindignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor,\\nhe fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a\\nghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great\\noak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures\\nappeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently\\nno time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth dimension of Space\\nas a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house\\nbecame quite quiet.\\n\\nOn reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up\\nagainst a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realize\\nhis position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three\\nhundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the\\nDowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before\\nthe glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone\\ninto hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains on\\none of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he\\nhad blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who\\nhad been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr\\nto nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having\\nwakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair\\nby the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six\\nweeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become\\nreconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that\\nnotorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible\\nnight when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his\\ndressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and\\nconfessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox\\nout of ¬£50,000 at Crockford\\'s by means of that very card, and swore that\\nthe ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back\\nto him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because\\nhe had seen a green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful\\nLady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round\\nher throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin,\\nand who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the\\nKing\\'s Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went\\nover his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as\\nhe recalled to mind his last appearance as \"Red Reuben, or the Strangled\\nBabe,\" his _d√©but_ as \"Guant Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,\"\\nand the _furore_ he had excited one lovely June evening by merely\\nplaying ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And\\nafter all this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him\\nthe Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite\\nunbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this\\nmanner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till\\ndaylight in an attitude of deep thought.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\nThe next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed\\nthe ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a\\nlittle annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. \"I have\\nno wish,\" he said, \"to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say\\nthat, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don\\'t\\nthink it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,\"--a very just remark,\\nat which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.\\n\"Upon the other hand,\" he continued, \"if he really declines to use the\\nRising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It\\nwould be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside\\nthe bedrooms.\"\\n\\nFor the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing\\nthat excited any attention being the continual renewal of the\\nblood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as\\nthe door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept\\nclosely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a\\ngood deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red,\\nthen it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came\\ndown for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free\\nAmerican Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright\\nemerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party\\nvery much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The\\nonly person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who,\\nfor some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the\\nsight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was\\nemerald-green.\\n\\nThe second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after\\nthey had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in\\nthe hall. Rushing down-stairs, they found that a large suit of old\\narmour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone\\nfloor, while seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville ghost,\\nrubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The\\ntwins, having brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged\\ntwo pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained\\nby long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United\\nStates Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in\\naccordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost\\nstarted up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a\\nmist, extinguishing Washington Otis\\'s candle as he passed, and so\\nleaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase\\nhe recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of\\ndemoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely\\nuseful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker\\'s wig grey in a single\\nnight, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville\\'s French\\ngovernesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly\\nlaughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and\\nrang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door\\nopened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. \"I am\\nafraid you are far from well,\" she said, \"and have brought you a bottle\\nof Doctor Dobell\\'s tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a\\nmost excellent remedy.\" The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at\\nonce to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an\\naccomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family\\ndoctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville\\'s\\nuncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps,\\nhowever, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself\\nwith becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep\\nchurchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"THE TWINS ... AT ONCE DISCHARGED TWO PELLETS ON HIM\"]\\n\\nOn reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the\\nmost violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross\\nmaterialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what\\nreally distressed him most was that he had been unable to wear the suit\\nof mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by\\nthe sight of a Spectre in armour, if for no more sensible reason, at\\nleast out of respect for their natural poet Longfellow, over whose\\ngraceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary\\nhour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides it was his own suit.\\nHe had worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had\\nbeen highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen\\nherself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered\\nby the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen\\nheavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and\\nbruising the knuckles of his right hand.\\n\\nFor some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of\\nhis room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair.\\nHowever, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to\\nmake a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his\\nfamily. He selected Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent\\nmost of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in\\nfavour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet\\nfrilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a\\nviolent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the\\nwindows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was\\njust such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to\\nmake his way quietly to Washington Otis\\'s room, gibber at him from the\\nfoot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound\\nof low music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware\\nthat it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville\\nblood-stain by means of Pinkerton\\'s Paragon Detergent. Having reduced\\nthe reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was\\nthen to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and\\nhis wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis\\'s forehead,\\nwhile he hissed into her trembling husband\\'s ear the awful secrets of\\nthe charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made\\nup his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and\\ngentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more\\nthan sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the\\ncounterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite\\ndetermined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of\\ncourse, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling\\nsensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each\\nother, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse,\\ntill they became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw off the\\nwinding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and\\none rolling eyeball, in the character of \"Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide\\'s\\nSkeleton,\" a _r√¥le_ in which he had on more than one occasion produced a\\ngreat effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of\\n\"Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.\"\\n\\nAt half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was\\ndisturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the\\nlight-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves\\nbefore they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still,\\nand, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the\\nwindow-panes, the raven croaked from the old yew-tree, and the wind\\nwandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family\\nslept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he\\ncould hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He\\nstepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his\\ncruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole\\npast the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his\\nmurdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like\\nan evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed.\\nOnce he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only\\nthe baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange\\nsixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger\\nin the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that\\nled to luckless Washington\\'s room. For a moment he paused there, the\\nwind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into\\ngrotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man\\'s\\nshroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was\\ncome. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had\\nhe done so than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid\\nhis blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was\\nstanding a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous\\nas a madman\\'s dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round,\\nand fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its\\nfeatures into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet\\nlight, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like\\nto his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast\\nwas a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of\\nshame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime,\\nand, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"ITS HEAD WAS BALD AND BURNISHED\"]\\n\\nNever having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened,\\nand, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to\\nhis room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he sped down the\\ncorridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister\\'s\\njack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the\\nprivacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small\\npallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however,\\nthe brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to\\ngo and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly,\\njust as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards\\nthe spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling\\nthat, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid\\nof his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching\\nthe spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had\\nevidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from\\nits hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it\\nwas leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable\\nattitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his\\nhorror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a\\nrecumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity\\nbed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow\\nturnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious\\ntransformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there,\\nin the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:--\\n\\n        +------------------------------------+\\n        |         YE OTIS GHOSTE             |\\n        | Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook, |\\n        |    Beware of Ye Imitationes.       |\\n        |   All others are counterfeite.     |\\n        +------------------------------------+\\n\\nThe whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and\\nout-witted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his\\ntoothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his\\nhead, swore according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique\\nschool, that, when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds\\nof blood would be wrought, and murder walk abroad with silent feet.\\n\\nHardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of\\na distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,\\nand waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange\\nreason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of\\nthe housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back\\nto his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he\\nconsulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was\\nexceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which this oath\\nhad been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. \"Perdition\\nseize the naughty fowl,\" he muttered, \"I have seen the day when, with my\\nstout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow\\nfor me an \\'twere in death!\" He then retired to a comfortable lead\\ncoffin, and stayed there till evening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: \"HE MET WITH A SEVERE FALL\"]\\n\\nThe next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement\\nof the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were\\ncompletely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five\\ndays he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point\\nof the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want\\nit, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a\\nlow, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating\\nthe symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic\\napparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a\\ndifferent matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn\\nduty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large\\noriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he\\ndid not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is\\nquite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand,\\nhe was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural.\\nFor the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as\\nusual between midnight and three o\\'clock, taking every possible\\nprecaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots,\\ntrod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large\\nblack velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for\\noiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good\\ndeal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of\\nprotection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he\\nslipped into Mr. Otis\\'s bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a\\nlittle humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see\\nthat there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a\\ncertain degree, it served his purpose. Still in spite of everything he\\nwas not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across\\nthe corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion,\\nwhile dressed for the part of \"Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley\\nWoods,\" he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,\\nwhich the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry\\nChamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged\\nhim, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and\\nsocial position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the\\nnext night in his celebrated character of \"Reckless Rupert, or the\\nHeadless Earl.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: \"A HEAVY JUG OF WATER FELL RIGHT DOWN ON HIM.\"]\\n\\nHe had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in\\nfact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means\\nof it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord\\nCanterville\\'s grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome\\nJack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to\\nmarry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and\\ndown the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by\\nLord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken\\nheart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it\\nhad been a great success. It was, however an extremely difficult\\n\"make-up,\" if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with\\none of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more\\nscientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three\\nhours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was\\nvery pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went\\nwith the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only\\nfind one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite\\nsatisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting\\nand crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins,\\nwhich I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of\\nthe colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make\\nan effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water\\nfell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his\\nleft shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled\\nshrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his\\nnervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he\\ncould go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only\\nthing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he\\nhad not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences\\nmight have been very serious.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"MAKING SATIRICAL REMARKS ON THE PHOTOGRAPHS\"]\\n\\nHe now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family,\\nand contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in\\nlist slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of\\ndraughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the\\ntwins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He\\nhad gone down-stairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that\\nthere, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing\\nhimself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of\\nthe United States Minister and his wife which had now taken the place of\\nthe Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long\\nshroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip\\nof yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton\\'s spade. In\\nfact, he was dressed for the character of \"Jonas the Graveless, or the\\nCorpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,\" one of his most remarkable\\nimpersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to\\nremember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their\\nneighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter-past two o\\'clock in\\nthe morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As\\nhe was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any\\ntraces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a\\ndark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads,\\nand shrieked out \"BOO!\" in his ear.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"SUDDENLY THERE LEAPED OUT TWO FIGURES.\"]\\n\\nSeized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural,\\nhe rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him\\nthere with the big garden-syringe, and being thus hemmed in by his\\nenemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the\\ngreat iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to\\nmake his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own\\nroom in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.\\n\\nAfter this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins\\nlay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with\\nnutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the\\nservants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings\\nwere so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed\\nhis great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had\\nbeen engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized a wonderful\\nclam-bake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse\\neuchre, poker, and other American national games, and Virginia rode\\nabout the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire,\\nwho had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville\\nChase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in\\nfact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who,\\nin reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best\\ncongratulations to the Minister\\'s worthy wife.\\n\\nThe Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the\\nhouse, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let\\nmatters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the\\nyoung Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had\\nonce bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice\\nwith the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the\\nfloor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state that, though\\nhe lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but\\n\"Double Sixes.\" The story was well known at the time, though, of course,\\nout of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt\\nwas made to hush it up, and a full account of all the circumstances\\nconnected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle\\'s\\n_Recollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends_. The ghost, then,\\nwas naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence\\nover the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his\\nown first cousin having been married _en secondes noces_ to the Sieur de\\nBulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are\\nlineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to\\nVirginia\\'s little lover in his celebrated impersonation of \"The Vampire\\nMonk, or the Bloodless Benedictine,\" a performance so horrible that when\\nold Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year\\'s Eve, in\\nthe year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which\\nculminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after\\ndisinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and\\nleaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment,\\nhowever, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the\\nlittle Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal\\nBedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\nA few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out\\nriding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting\\nthrough a hedge that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go\\nup by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past\\nthe Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be open, she fancied\\nshe saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother\\'s maid, who\\nsometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend\\nher habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville\\nGhost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of\\nthe yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing\\nmadly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his\\nwhole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so\\nmuch out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea\\nhad been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity,\\nand determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so\\ndeep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she\\nspoke to him.\\n\\n\"I am so sorry for you,\" she said, \"but my brothers are going back to\\nEton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"It is absurd asking me to behave myself,\" he answered, looking round in\\nastonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,\\n\"quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and\\nwalk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for\\nexisting.\"\\n\\n\"It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very\\nwicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had\\nkilled your wife.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I quite admit it,\" said the Ghost, petulantly, \"but it was a\\npurely family matter, and concerned no one else.\"\\n\\n\"It is very wrong to kill any one,\" said Virginia, who at times had a\\nsweet puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.\\n\\n\"Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very\\nplain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about\\ncookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent\\npricket, and do you know how she had it sent to table? However, it is\\nno matter now, for it is all over, and I don\\'t think it was very nice of\\nher brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.\"\\n\\n\"Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost--I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I\\nhave a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?\"\\n\\n\"No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you,\\nall the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,\\nvulgar, dishonest family.\"\\n\\n\"Stop!\" cried Virginia, stamping her foot, \"it is you who are rude, and\\nhorrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the\\npaints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain\\nin the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and\\nI couldn\\'t do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the\\nchrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese\\nwhite, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing\\nto look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I\\nwas very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for\\nwho ever heard of emerald-green blood?\"\\n\\n\"Well, really,\" said the Ghost, rather meekly, \"what was I to do? It is\\na very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother\\nbegan it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I\\nshould not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of\\ntaste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest\\nin England; but I know you Americans don\\'t care for things of this\\nkind.\"\\n\\n\"You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate\\nand improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a\\nfree passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind,\\nthere will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are\\nall Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I\\nknow lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to\\nhave a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family ghost.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I should like America.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,\" said Virginia,\\nsatirically.\\n\\n\"No ruins! no curiosities!\" answered the Ghost; \"you have your navy and\\nyour manners.\"\\n\\n\"Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week\\'s\\nholiday.\"\\n\\n\"Please don\\'t go, Miss Virginia,\" he cried; \"I am so lonely and so\\nunhappy, and I really don\\'t know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I\\ncannot.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the\\ncandle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at\\nchurch, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even\\nbabies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.\"\\n\\n\"I have not slept for three hundred years,\" he said sadly, and\\nVirginia\\'s beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; \"for three hundred\\nyears I have not slept, and I am so tired.\"\\n\\nVirginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like\\nrose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked\\nup into his old withered face.\\n\\n\"Poor, poor Ghost,\" she murmured; \"have you no place where you can\\nsleep?\"\\n\\n[Illustration: \"\\'POOR, POOR GHOST,\\' SHE MURMURED; \\'HAVE YOU NO PLACE\\nWHERE YOU CAN SLEEP?\\'\"]\\n\\n\"Far away beyond the pine-woods,\" he answered, in a low, dreamy voice,\\n\"there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there\\nare the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale\\nsings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal\\nmoon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the\\nsleepers.\"\\n\\nVirginia\\'s eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.\\n\\n\"You mean the Garden of Death,\" she whispered.\\n\\n\"Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth,\\nwith the grasses waving above one\\'s head, and listen to silence. To have\\nno yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at\\npeace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of death\\'s\\nhouse, for love is always with you, and love is stronger than death\\nis.\"\\n\\nVirginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments\\nthere was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.\\n\\nThen the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of\\nthe wind.\\n\\n\"Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, often,\" cried the little girl, looking up; \"I know it quite well.\\nIt is painted in curious black letters, and is difficult to read. There\\nare only six lines:\\n\\n    \"\\'When a golden girl can win\\n    Prayer from out the lips of sin,\\n    When the barren almond bears,\\n    And a little child gives away its tears,\\n    Then shall all the house be still\\n    And peace come to Canterville.\\'\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t know what they mean.\"\\n\\n\"They mean,\" he said, sadly, \"that you must weep with me for my sins,\\nbecause I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no\\nfaith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle,\\nthe angel of death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in\\ndarkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not\\nharm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell\\ncannot prevail.\"\\n\\nVirginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung his hands in wild despair\\nas he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very\\npale, and with a strange light in her eyes. \"I am not afraid,\" she said\\nfirmly, \"and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you.\"\\n\\nHe rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent\\nover it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold\\nas ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as\\nhe led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were\\nbroidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with\\ntheir tiny hands waved to her to go back. \"Go back! little Virginia,\"\\nthey cried, \"go back!\" but the ghost clutched her hand more tightly,\\nand she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails\\nand goggle eyes blinked at her from the carven chimneypiece, and\\nmurmured, \"Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,\"\\nbut the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When\\nthey reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she\\ncould not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly\\nfading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A\\nbitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her\\ndress. \"Quick, quick,\" cried the Ghost, \"or it will be too late,\" and\\nin a moment the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry\\nChamber was empty.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"THE GHOST GLIDED ON MORE SWIFTLY\"]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\n\\nAbout ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not\\ncome down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a\\nlittle time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia\\nanywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every\\nevening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all\\nalarmed at first, but when six o\\'clock struck, and Virginia did not\\nappear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for\\nher, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At\\nhalf-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace\\nof their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of\\nexcitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly\\nremembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies\\npermission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for\\nBlackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son\\nand two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was\\nperfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too,\\nbut Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a\\nscuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had\\ngone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as\\nthe fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass.\\nHaving sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran\\nhome, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the\\ncounty, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been\\nkidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought\\nround, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down\\nto dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with a groom. He had hardly,\\nhowever, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after\\nhim, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with\\nhis face very flushed, and no hat. \"I\\'m awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,\" gasped\\nout the boy, \"but I can\\'t eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost.\\nPlease don\\'t be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year,\\nthere would never have been all this trouble. You won\\'t send me back,\\nwill you? I can\\'t go! I won\\'t go!\"\\n\\n[Illustration: \"HE HEARD SOMEBODY GALLOPING AFTER HIM\"]\\n\\nThe Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace,\\nand was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down\\nfrom his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, \"Well,\\nCecil, if you won\\'t go back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must\\nget you a hat at Ascot.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!\" cried the little Duke, laughing,\\nand they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of\\nthe station-master if any one answering to the description of Virginia\\nhad been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The\\nstation-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him\\nthat a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a\\nhat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his\\nshutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away,\\nwhich he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a\\nlarge common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but\\ncould get no information from him, and, after riding all over the\\ncommon, they turned their horses\\' heads homewards, and reached the Chase\\nabout eleven o\\'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken. They found\\nWashington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with\\nlanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of\\nVirginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley\\nmeadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden\\ndeparture by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and\\nhad gone off in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed, they had\\nbeen quite distressed at hearing of Virginia\\'s disappearance, as they\\nwere very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his\\npark, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search.\\nThe carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone\\nover, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any\\nrate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest\\ndepression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom\\nfollowing behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they\\nfound a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library\\nwas poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and\\nhaving her forehead bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.\\nMr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up\\nsupper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one\\nspoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very\\nfond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the\\nentreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that\\nnothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in\\nthe morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down\\nimmediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight\\nbegan to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded\\nthey heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder\\nshook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a\\npanel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out\\non the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her\\nhand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs.\\nOtis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with\\nviolent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"OUT ON THE LANDING STEPPED VIRGINIA\"]\\n\\n\"Good heavens! child, where have you been?\" said Mr. Otis, rather\\nangrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them.\\n\"Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and\\nyour mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these\\npractical jokes any more.\"\\n\\n\"Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!\" shrieked the twins, as they\\ncapered about.\\n\\n\"My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side\\nagain,\" murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and\\nsmoothed the tangled gold of her hair.\\n\\n\"Papa,\" said Virginia, quietly, \"I have been with the Ghost. He is dead,\\nand you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was\\nreally sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of\\nbeautiful jewels before he died.\"\\n\\nThe whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave\\nand serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the\\nwainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a\\nlighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they\\ncame to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia\\ntouched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves\\nin a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated\\nwindow. Imbedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was\\na gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone\\nfloor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers\\nan old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its\\nreach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was\\ncovered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but\\na pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding\\nher little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the\\nparty looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now\\ndisclosed to them.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"CHAINED TO IT WAS A GAUNT SKELETON\"]\\n\\n\"Hallo!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out\\nof the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was\\nsituated. \"Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see\\nthe flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.\"\\n\\n\"God has forgiven him,\" said Virginia, gravely, as she rose to her feet,\\nand a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.\\n\\n\"What an angel you are!\" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round\\nher neck, and kissed her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: \"BY THE SIDE OF THE HEARSE AND THE COACHES WALKED THE\\nSERVANTS WITH LIGHTED TORCHES\"]\\n\\nFour days after these curious incidents, a funeral started from\\nCanterville Chase at about eleven o\\'clock at night. The hearse was drawn\\nby eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of\\nnodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich\\npurple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville\\ncoat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the\\nservants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully\\nimpressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up\\nspecially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first\\ncarriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States\\nMinister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the\\nlast carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had\\nbeen frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she\\nhad a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the\\ncorner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service\\nwas read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier.\\nWhen the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom\\nobserved in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as\\nthe coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward,\\nand laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As\\nshe did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its\\nsilent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a\\nnightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost\\'s description of the\\nGarden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a\\nword during the drive home.\\n\\n[Illustration: \"THE MOON CAME OUT FROM BEHIND A CLOUD\"]\\n\\nThe next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had\\nan interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given\\nto Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby\\nnecklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen\\nof sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis\\nfelt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\\n\\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"I know that in this country mortmain is held to\\napply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that\\nthese jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg\\nyou, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them\\nsimply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you\\nunder certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a\\nchild, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such\\nappurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I\\nmay say, is no mean authority upon Art,--having had the privilege of\\nspending several winters in Boston when she was a girl,--that these gems\\nare of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall\\nprice. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you\\nwill recognize how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain\\nin the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such\\nvain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the\\nBritish aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who\\nhave been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles\\nof Republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very\\nanxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of\\nyour unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and\\nconsequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to\\ncomply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal\\nsurprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi√¶valism\\nin any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was\\nborn in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned\\nfrom a trip to Athens.\"\\n\\nLord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister\\'s speech,\\npulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile,\\nand when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and\\nsaid: \"My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky\\nancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are\\nmuch indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels\\nare clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough\\nto take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave\\nin a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being\\nheirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or\\nlegal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite\\nunknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and\\nwhen Miss Virginia grows up, I dare say she will be pleased to have\\npretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the\\nfurniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to\\nthe ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity\\nSir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he\\nwas really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.\"\\n\\nMr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville\\'s refusal, and\\nbegged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was\\nquite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to\\nretain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of\\n1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen\\'s first\\ndrawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the\\nuniversal theme of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which\\nis the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her\\nboy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and\\nthey loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the\\nmatch, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch\\nthe Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less\\nthan three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to\\nsay, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke\\npersonally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his\\nown words, \"was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating\\ninfluences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of\\nRepublican simplicity should be forgotten.\" His objections, however,\\nwere completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the\\naisle of St. George\\'s, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his\\narm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of\\nEngland.\\n\\nThe Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to\\nCanterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over\\nin the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. There had\\nbeen a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir\\nSimon\\'s tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it\\nsimply the initials of the old gentleman\\'s name, and the verse from the\\nlibrary window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses,\\nwhich she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for\\nsome time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There\\nthe Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her\\nfeet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly\\nhe threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her,\\n\"Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.\"\\n\\n\"Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, you have,\" he answered, smiling, \"you have never told me what\\nhappened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.\"\\n\\n\"I have never told any one, Cecil,\" said Virginia, gravely.\\n\\n\"I know that, but you might tell me.\"\\n\\n\"Please don\\'t ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe\\nhim a great deal. Yes, don\\'t laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see\\nwhat Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than\\nboth.\"\\n\\nThe Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.\\n\\n\"You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,\" he murmured.\\n\\n\"You have always had that, Cecil.\"\\n\\n\"And you will tell our children some day, won\\'t you?\"\\n\\nVirginia blushed.\\n\\n\\n\\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CANTERVILLE GHOST***\\n\\n\\n******* This file should be named 14522-8.txt or 14522-8.zip *******\\n\\n\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/4/5/2/14522\\n\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

His courtiers had all\\ntaken their leave of him, bowing their heads to the ground, according to\\nthe ceremonious usage of the day, and had retired to the Great Hall of\\nthe Palace, to receive a few last lessons from the Professor of\\nEtiquette; there being some of them who had still quite natural manners,\\nwhich in a courtier is, I need hardly say, a very grave offence.\\n\\nThe lad‚Äîfor he was only a lad, being but sixteen years of age‚Äîwas not\\nsorry at their departure, and had flung himself back with a deep sigh of\\nrelief on the soft cushions of his embroidered couch, lying there,\\nwild-eyed and open-mouthed, like a brown woodland Faun, or some young\\nanimal of the forest newly snared by the hunters.\\n\\nAnd, indeed, it was the hunters who had found him, coming upon him almost\\nby chance as, bare-limbed and pipe in hand, he was following the flock of\\nthe poor goatherd who had brought him up, and whose son he had always\\nfancied himself to be.  The child of the old King‚Äôs only daughter by a\\nsecret marriage with one much beneath her in station‚Äîa stranger, some\\nsaid, who, by the wonderful magic of his lute-playing, had made the young\\nPrincess love him; while others spoke of an artist from Rimini, to whom\\nthe Princess had shown much, perhaps too much honour, and who had\\nsuddenly disappeared from the city, leaving his work in the Cathedral\\nunfinished‚Äîhe had been, when but a week old, stolen away from his\\nmother‚Äôs side, as she slept, and given into the charge of a common\\npeasant and his wife, who were without children of their own, and lived\\nin a remote part of the forest, more than a day‚Äôs ride from the town.\\nGrief, or the plague, as the court physician stated, or, as some\\nsuggested, a swift Italian poison administered in a cup of spiced wine,\\nslew, within an hour of her wakening, the white girl who had given him\\nbirth, and as the trusty messenger who bare the child across his\\nsaddle-bow stooped from his weary horse and knocked at the rude door of\\nthe goatherd‚Äôs hut, the body of the Princess was being lowered into an\\nopen grave that had been dug in a deserted churchyard, beyond the city\\ngates, a grave where it was said that another body was also lying, that\\nof a young man of marvellous and foreign beauty, whose hands were tied\\nbehind him with a knotted cord, and whose breast was stabbed with many\\nred wounds.\\n\\nSuch, at least, was the story that men whispered to each other.  Certain\\nit was that the old King, when on his deathbed, whether moved by remorse\\nfor his great sin, or merely desiring that the kingdom should not pass\\naway from his line, had had the lad sent for, and, in the presence of the\\nCouncil, had acknowledged him as his heir.\\n\\nAnd it seems that from the very first moment of his recognition he had\\nshown signs of that strange passion for beauty that was destined to have\\nso great an influence over his life.  Those who accompanied him to the\\nsuite of rooms set apart for his service, often spoke of the cry of\\npleasure that broke from his lips when he saw the delicate raiment and\\nrich jewels that had been prepared for him, and of the almost fierce joy\\nwith which he flung aside his rough leathern tunic and coarse sheepskin\\ncloak.  He missed, indeed, at times the fine freedom of his forest life,\\nand was always apt to chafe at the tedious Court ceremonies that occupied\\nso much of each day, but the wonderful palace‚Äî_Joyeuse_, as they called\\nit‚Äîof which he now found himself lord, seemed to him to be a new world\\nfresh-fashioned for his delight; and as soon as he could escape from the\\ncouncil-board or audience-chamber, he would run down the great staircase,\\nwith its lions of gilt bronze and its steps of bright porphyry, and\\nwander from room to room, and from corridor to corridor, like one who was\\nseeking to find in beauty an anodyne from pain, a sort of restoration\\nfrom sickness.\\n\\nUpon these journeys of discovery, as he would call them‚Äîand, indeed, they\\nwere to him real voyages through a marvellous land, he would sometimes be\\naccompanied by the slim, fair-haired Court pages, with their floating\\nmantles, and gay fluttering ribands; but more often he would be alone,\\nfeeling through a certain quick instinct, which was almost a divination,\\nthat the secrets of art are best learned in secret, and that Beauty, like\\nWisdom, loves the lonely worshipper.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nMany curious stories were related about him at this period.  It was said\\nthat a stout Burgo-master, who had come to deliver a florid oratorical\\naddress on behalf of the citizens of the town, had caught sight of him\\nkneeling in real adoration before a great picture that had just been\\nbrought from Venice, and that seemed to herald the worship of some new\\ngods.  On another occasion he had been missed for several hours, and\\nafter a lengthened search had been discovered in a little chamber in one\\nof the northern turrets of the palace gazing, as one in a trance, at a\\nGreek gem carved with the figure of Adonis.  He had been seen, so the\\ntale ran, pressing his warm lips to the marble brow of an antique statue\\nthat had been discovered in the bed of the river on the occasion of the\\nbuilding of the stone bridge, and was inscribed with the name of the\\nBithynian slave of Hadrian.  He had passed a whole night in noting the\\neffect of the moonlight on a silver image of Endymion.\\n\\nAll rare and costly materials had certainly a great fascination for him,\\nand in his eagerness to procure them he had sent away many merchants,\\nsome to traffic for amber with the rough fisher-folk of the north seas,\\nsome to Egypt to look for that curious green turquoise which is found\\nonly in the tombs of kings, and is said to possess magical properties,\\nsome to Persia for silken carpets and painted pottery, and others to\\nIndia to buy gauze and stained ivory, moonstones and bracelets of jade,\\nsandal-wood and blue enamel and shawls of fine wool.\\n\\nBut what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his\\ncoronation, the robe of tissued gold, and the ruby-studded crown, and the\\nsceptre with its rows and rings of pearls.  Indeed, it was of this that\\nhe was thinking to-night, as he lay back on his luxurious couch, watching\\nthe great pinewood log that was burning itself out on the open hearth.\\nThe designs, which were from the hands of the most famous artists of the\\ntime, had been submitted to him many months before, and he had given\\norders that the artificers were to toil night and day to carry them out,\\nand that the whole world was to be searched for jewels that would be\\nworthy of their work.  He saw himself in fancy standing at the high altar\\nof the cathedral in the fair raiment of a King, and a smile played and\\nlingered about his boyish lips, and lit up with a bright lustre his dark\\nwoodland eyes.\\n\\nAfter some time he rose from his seat, and leaning against the carved\\npenthouse of the chimney, looked round at the dimly-lit room.  The walls\\nwere hung with rich tapestries representing the Triumph of Beauty.  A\\nlarge press, inlaid with agate and lapis-lazuli, filled one corner, and\\nfacing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels\\nof powdered and mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets\\nof Venetian glass, and a cup of dark-veined onyx.  Pale poppies were\\nbroidered on the silk coverlet of the bed, as though they had fallen from\\nthe tired hands of sleep, and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the\\nvelvet canopy, from which great tufts of ostrich plumes sprang, like\\nwhite foam, to the pallid silver of the fretted ceiling.  A laughing\\nNarcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror above its head.  On the\\ntable stood a flat bowl of amethyst.\\n\\nOutside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral, looming like a\\nbubble over the shadowy houses, and the weary sentinels pacing up and\\ndown on the misty terrace by the river.  Far away, in an orchard, a\\nnightingale was singing.  A faint perfume of jasmine came through the\\nopen window.  He brushed his brown curls back from his forehead, and\\ntaking up a lute, let his fingers stray across the cords.  His heavy\\neyelids drooped, and a strange languor came over him.  Never before had\\nhe felt so keenly, or with such exquisite joy, the magic and the mystery\\nof beautiful things.\\n\\nWhen midnight sounded from the clock-tower he touched a bell, and his\\npages entered and disrobed him with much ceremony, pouring rose-water\\nover his hands, and strewing flowers on his pillow.  A few moments after\\nthat they had left the room, he fell asleep.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd as he slept he dreamed a dream, and this was his dream.\\n\\nHe thought that he was standing in a long, low attic, amidst the whir and\\nclatter of many looms.  The meagre daylight peered in through the grated\\nwindows, and showed him the gaunt figures of the weavers bending over\\ntheir cases.  Pale, sickly-looking children were crouched on the huge\\ncrossbeams.  As the shuttles dashed through the warp they lifted up the\\nheavy battens, and when the shuttles stopped they let the battens fall\\nand pressed the threads together.  Their faces were pinched with famine,\\nand their thin hands shook and trembled.  Some haggard women were seated\\nat a table sewing.  A horrible odour filled the place.  The air was foul\\nand heavy, and the walls dripped and streamed with damp.\\n\\nThe young King went over to one of the weavers, and stood by him and\\nwatched him.\\n\\nAnd the weaver looked at him angrily, and said, ‚ÄòWhy art thou watching\\nme?  Art thou a spy set on us by our master?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòWho is thy master?‚Äô asked the young King.\\n\\n‚ÄòOur master!‚Äô cried the weaver, bitterly.  ‚ÄòHe is a man like myself.\\nIndeed, there is but this difference between us‚Äîthat he wears fine\\nclothes while I go in rags, and that while I am weak from hunger he\\nsuffers not a little from overfeeding.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòThe land is free,‚Äô said the young King, ‚Äòand thou art no man‚Äôs slave.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòIn war,‚Äô answered the weaver, ‚Äòthe strong make slaves of the weak, and\\nin peace the rich make slaves of the poor.  We must work to live, and\\nthey give us such mean wages that we die.  We toil for them all day long,\\nand they heap up gold in their coffers, and our children fade away before\\ntheir time, and the faces of those we love become hard and evil.  We\\ntread out the grapes, and another drinks the wine.  We sow the corn, and\\nour own board is empty.  We have chains, though no eye beholds them; and\\nare slaves, though men call us free.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòIs it so with all?‚Äô he asked,\\n\\n‚ÄòIt is so with all,‚Äô answered the weaver, ‚Äòwith the young as well as with\\nthe old, with the women as well as with the men, with the little children\\nas well as with those who are stricken in years.  The merchants grind us\\ndown, and we must needs do their bidding.  The priest rides by and tells\\nhis beads, and no man has care of us.  Through our sunless lanes creeps\\nPoverty with her hungry eyes, and Sin with his sodden face follows close\\nbehind her.  Misery wakes us in the morning, and Shame sits with us at\\nnight.  But what are these things to thee?  Thou art not one of us.  Thy\\nface is too happy.‚Äô  And he turned away scowling, and threw the shuttle\\nacross the loom, and the young King saw that it was threaded with a\\nthread of gold.\\n\\nAnd a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver, ‚ÄòWhat robe\\nis this that thou art weaving?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòIt is the robe for the coronation of the young King,‚Äô he answered; ‚Äòwhat\\nis that to thee?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the young King gave a loud cry and woke, and lo! he was in his own\\nchamber, and through the window he saw the great honey-coloured moon\\nhanging in the dusky air.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd he fell asleep again and dreamed, and this was his dream.\\n\\nHe thought that he was lying on the deck of a huge galley that was being\\nrowed by a hundred slaves.  On a carpet by his side the master of the\\ngalley was seated.  He was black as ebony, and his turban was of crimson\\nsilk.  Great earrings of silver dragged down the thick lobes of his ears,\\nand in his hands he had a pair of ivory scales.\\n\\nThe slaves were naked, but for a ragged loin-cloth, and each man was\\nchained to his neighbour.  The hot sun beat brightly upon them, and the\\nnegroes ran up and down the gangway and lashed them with whips of hide.\\nThey stretched out their lean arms and pulled the heavy oars through the\\nwater.  The salt spray flew from the blades.\\n\\nAt last they reached a little bay, and began to take soundings.  A light\\nwind blew from the shore, and covered the deck and the great lateen sail\\nwith a fine red dust.  Three Arabs mounted on wild asses rode out and\\nthrew spears at them.  The master of the galley took a painted bow in his\\nhand and shot one of them in the throat.  He fell heavily into the surf,\\nand his companions galloped away.  A woman wrapped in a yellow veil\\nfollowed slowly on a camel, looking back now and then at the dead body.\\n\\nAs soon as they had cast anchor and hauled down the sail, the negroes\\nwent into the hold and brought up a long rope-ladder, heavily weighted\\nwith lead.  The master of the galley threw it over the side, making the\\nends fast to two iron stanchions.  Then the negroes seized the youngest\\nof the slaves and knocked his gyves off, and filled his nostrils and his\\nears with wax, and tied a big stone round his waist.  He crept wearily\\ndown the ladder, and disappeared into the sea.  A few bubbles rose where\\nhe sank.  Some of the other slaves peered curiously over the side.  At\\nthe prow of the galley sat a shark-charmer, beating monotonously upon a\\ndrum.\\n\\nAfter some time the diver rose up out of the water, and clung panting to\\nthe ladder with a pearl in his right hand.  The negroes seized it from\\nhim, and thrust him back.  The slaves fell asleep over their oars.\\n\\nAgain and again he came up, and each time that he did so he brought with\\nhim a beautiful pearl.  The master of the galley weighed them, and put\\nthem into a little bag of green leather.\\n\\nThe young King tried to speak, but his tongue seemed to cleave to the\\nroof of his mouth, and his lips refused to move.  The negroes chattered\\nto each other, and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads.  Two\\ncranes flew round and round the vessel.\\n\\nThen the diver came up for the last time, and the pearl that he brought\\nwith him was fairer than all the pearls of Ormuz, for it was shaped like\\nthe full moon, and whiter than the morning star.  But his face was\\nstrangely pale, and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his\\nears and nostrils.  He quivered for a little, and then he was still.  The\\nnegroes shrugged their shoulders, and threw the body overboard.\\n\\nAnd the master of the galley laughed, and, reaching out, he took the\\npearl, and when he saw it he pressed it to his forehead and bowed.  ‚ÄòIt\\nshall be,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòfor the sceptre of the young King,‚Äô and he made a\\nsign to the negroes to draw up the anchor.\\n\\nAnd when the young King heard this he gave a great cry, and woke, and\\nthrough the window he saw the long grey fingers of the dawn clutching at\\nthe fading stars.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd he fell asleep again, and dreamed, and this was his dream.\\n\\nHe thought that he was wandering through a dim wood, hung with strange\\nfruits and with beautiful poisonous flowers.  The adders hissed at him as\\nhe went by, and the bright parrots flew screaming from branch to branch.\\nHuge tortoises lay asleep upon the hot mud.  The trees were full of apes\\nand peacocks.\\n\\nOn and on he went, till he reached the outskirts of the wood, and there\\nhe saw an immense multitude of men toiling in the bed of a dried-up\\nriver.  They swarmed up the crag like ants.  They dug deep pits in the\\nground and went down into them.  Some of them cleft the rocks with great\\naxes; others grabbled in the sand.\\n\\nThey tore up the cactus by its roots, and trampled on the scarlet\\nblossoms.  They hurried about, calling to each other, and no man was\\nidle.\\n\\nFrom the darkness of a cavern Death and Avarice watched them, and Death\\nsaid, ‚ÄòI am weary; give me a third of them and let me go.‚Äô  But Avarice\\nshook her head.  ‚ÄòThey are my servants,‚Äô she answered.\\n\\nAnd Death said to her, ‚ÄòWhat hast thou in thy hand?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòI have three grains of corn,‚Äô she answered; ‚Äòwhat is that to thee?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòGive me one of them,‚Äô cried Death, ‚Äòto plant in my garden; only one of\\nthem, and I will go away.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòI will not give thee anything,‚Äô said Avarice, and she hid her hand in\\nthe fold of her raiment.\\n\\nAnd Death laughed, and took a cup, and dipped it into a pool of water,\\nand out of the cup rose Ague.  She passed through the great multitude,\\nand a third of them lay dead.  A cold mist followed her, and the\\nwater-snakes ran by her side.\\n\\nAnd when Avarice saw that a third of the multitude was dead she beat her\\nbreast and wept.  She beat her barren bosom, and cried aloud.  ‚ÄòThou hast\\nslain a third of my servants,‚Äô she cried, ‚Äòget thee gone.  There is war\\nin the mountains of Tartary, and the kings of each side are calling to\\nthee.  The Afghans have slain the black ox, and are marching to battle.\\nThey have beaten upon their shields with their spears, and have put on\\ntheir helmets of iron.  What is my valley to thee, that thou shouldst\\ntarry in it?  Get thee gone, and come here no more.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay,‚Äô answered Death, ‚Äòbut till thou hast given me a grain of corn I\\nwill not go.‚Äô\\n\\nBut Avarice shut her hand, and clenched her teeth.  ‚ÄòI will not give thee\\nanything,‚Äô she muttered.\\n\\nAnd Death laughed, and took up a black stone, and threw it into the\\nforest, and out of a thicket of wild hemlock came Fever in a robe of\\nflame.  She passed through the multitude, and touched them, and each man\\nthat she touched died.  The grass withered beneath her feet as she\\nwalked.\\n\\nAnd Avarice shuddered, and put ashes on her head.  ‚ÄòThou art cruel,‚Äô she\\ncried; ‚Äòthou art cruel.  There is famine in the walled cities of India,\\nand the cisterns of Samarcand have run dry.  There is famine in the\\nwalled cities of Egypt, and the locusts have come up from the desert.\\nThe Nile has not overflowed its banks, and the priests have cursed Isis\\nand Osiris.  Get thee gone to those who need thee, and leave me my\\nservants.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay,‚Äô answered Death, ‚Äòbut till thou hast given me a grain of corn I\\nwill not go.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòI will not give thee anything,‚Äô said Avarice.\\n\\nAnd Death laughed again, and he whistled through his fingers, and a woman\\ncame flying through the air.  Plague was written upon her forehead, and a\\ncrowd of lean vultures wheeled round her.  She covered the valley with\\nher wings, and no man was left alive.\\n\\nAnd Avarice fled shrieking through the forest, and Death leaped upon his\\nred horse and galloped away, and his galloping was faster than the wind.\\n\\nAnd out of the slime at the bottom of the valley crept dragons and\\nhorrible things with scales, and the jackals came trotting along the\\nsand, sniffing up the air with their nostrils.\\n\\nAnd the young King wept, and said: ‚ÄòWho were these men, and for what were\\nthey seeking?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòFor rubies for a king‚Äôs crown,‚Äô answered one who stood behind him.\\n\\nAnd the young King started, and, turning round, he saw a man habited as a\\npilgrim and holding in his hand a mirror of silver.\\n\\nAnd he grew pale, and said: ‚ÄòFor what king?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the pilgrim answered: ‚ÄòLook in this mirror, and thou shalt see him.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd he looked in the mirror, and, seeing his own face, he gave a great\\ncry and woke, and the bright sunlight was streaming into the room, and\\nfrom the trees of the garden and pleasaunce the birds were singing.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd the Chamberlain and the high officers of State came in and made\\nobeisance to him, and the pages brought him the robe of tissued gold, and\\nset the crown and the sceptre before him.\\n\\nAnd the young King looked at them, and they were beautiful.  More\\nbeautiful were they than aught that he had ever seen.  But he remembered\\nhis dreams, and he said to his lords: ‚ÄòTake these things away, for I will\\nnot wear them.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the courtiers were amazed, and some of them laughed, for they thought\\nthat he was jesting.\\n\\nBut he spake sternly to them again, and said: ‚ÄòTake these things away,\\nand hide them from me.  Though it be the day of my coronation, I will not\\nwear them.  For on the loom of Sorrow, and by the white hands of Pain,\\nhas this my robe been woven.  There is Blood in the heart of the ruby,\\nand Death in the heart of the pearl.‚Äô  And he told them his three dreams.\\n\\nAnd when the courtiers heard them they looked at each other and\\nwhispered, saying: ‚ÄòSurely he is mad; for what is a dream but a dream,\\nand a vision but a vision?  They are not real things that one should heed\\nthem.  And what have we to do with the lives of those who toil for us?\\nShall a man not eat bread till he has seen the sower, nor drink wine till\\nhe has talked with the vinedresser?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Chamberlain spake to the young King, and said, ‚ÄòMy lord, I pray\\nthee set aside these black thoughts of thine, and put on this fair robe,\\nand set this crown upon thy head.  For how shall the people know that\\nthou art a king, if thou hast not a king‚Äôs raiment?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the young King looked at him.  ‚ÄòIs it so, indeed?‚Äô he questioned.\\n‚ÄòWill they not know me for a king if I have not a king‚Äôs raiment?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòThey will not know thee, my lord,‚Äô cried the Chamberlain.\\n\\n‚ÄòI had thought that there had been men who were kinglike,‚Äô he answered,\\n‚Äòbut it may be as thou sayest.  And yet I will not wear this robe, nor\\nwill I be crowned with this crown, but even as I came to the palace so\\nwill I go forth from it.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd he bade them all leave him, save one page whom he kept as his\\ncompanion, a lad a year younger than himself.  Him he kept for his\\nservice, and when he had bathed himself in clear water, he opened a great\\npainted chest, and from it he took the leathern tunic and rough sheepskin\\ncloak that he had worn when he had watched on the hillside the shaggy\\ngoats of the goatherd.  These he put on, and in his hand he took his rude\\nshepherd‚Äôs staff.\\n\\nAnd the little page opened his big blue eyes in wonder, and said smiling\\nto him, ‚ÄòMy lord, I see thy robe and thy sceptre, but where is thy\\ncrown?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the young King plucked a spray of wild briar that was climbing over\\nthe balcony, and bent it, and made a circlet of it, and set it on his own\\nhead.\\n\\n‚ÄòThis shall he my crown,‚Äô he answered.\\n\\nAnd thus attired he passed out of his chamber into the Great Hall, where\\nthe nobles were waiting for him.\\n\\nAnd the nobles made merry, and some of them cried out to him, ‚ÄòMy lord,\\nthe people wait for their king, and thou showest them a beggar,‚Äô and\\nothers were wroth and said, ‚ÄòHe brings shame upon our state, and is\\nunworthy to be our master.‚Äô  But he answered them not a word, but passed\\non, and went down the bright porphyry staircase, and out through the\\ngates of bronze, and mounted upon his horse, and rode towards the\\ncathedral, the little page running beside him.\\n\\nAnd the people laughed and said, ‚ÄòIt is the King‚Äôs fool who is riding\\nby,‚Äô and they mocked him.\\n\\nAnd he drew rein and said, ‚ÄòNay, but I am the King.‚Äô  And he told them\\nhis three dreams.\\n\\nAnd a man came out of the crowd and spake bitterly to him, and said,\\n‚ÄòSir, knowest thou not that out of the luxury of the rich cometh the life\\nof the poor?  By your pomp we are nurtured, and your vices give us bread.\\nTo toil for a hard master is bitter, but to have no master to toil for is\\nmore bitter still.  Thinkest thou that the ravens will feed us?  And what\\ncure hast thou for these things?  Wilt thou say to the buyer, ‚ÄúThou shalt\\nbuy for so much,‚Äù and to the seller, ‚ÄúThou shalt sell at this price‚Äù?  I\\ntrow not.  Therefore go back to thy Palace and put on thy purple and fine\\nlinen.  What hast thou to do with us, and what we suffer?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòAre not the rich and the poor brothers?‚Äô asked the young King.\\n\\n‚ÄòAy,‚Äô answered the man, ‚Äòand the name of the rich brother is Cain.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the young King‚Äôs eyes filled with tears, and he rode on through the\\nmurmurs of the people, and the little page grew afraid and left him.\\n\\nAnd when he reached the great portal of the cathedral, the soldiers\\nthrust their halberts out and said, ‚ÄòWhat dost thou seek here?  None\\nenters by this door but the King.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd his face flushed with anger, and he said to them, ‚ÄòI am the King,‚Äô\\nand waved their halberts aside and passed in.\\n\\nAnd when the old Bishop saw him coming in his goatherd‚Äôs dress, he rose\\nup in wonder from his throne, and went to meet him, and said to him, ‚ÄòMy\\nson, is this a king‚Äôs apparel?  And with what crown shall I crown thee,\\nand what sceptre shall I place in thy hand?  Surely this should be to\\nthee a day of joy, and not a day of abasement.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòShall Joy wear what Grief has fashioned?‚Äô said the young King.  And he\\ntold him his three dreams.\\n\\nAnd when the Bishop had heard them he knit his brows, and said, ‚ÄòMy son,\\nI am an old man, and in the winter of my days, and I know that many evil\\nthings are done in the wide world.  The fierce robbers come down from the\\nmountains, and carry off the little children, and sell them to the Moors.\\nThe lions lie in wait for the caravans, and leap upon the camels.  The\\nwild boar roots up the corn in the valley, and the foxes gnaw the vines\\nupon the hill.  The pirates lay waste the sea-coast and burn the ships of\\nthe fishermen, and take their nets from them.  In the salt-marshes live\\nthe lepers; they have houses of wattled reeds, and none may come nigh\\nthem.  The beggars wander through the cities, and eat their food with the\\ndogs.  Canst thou make these things not to be?  Wilt thou take the leper\\nfor thy bedfellow, and set the beggar at thy board?  Shall the lion do\\nthy bidding, and the wild boar obey thee?  Is not He who made misery\\nwiser than thou art?  Wherefore I praise thee not for this that thou hast\\ndone, but I bid thee ride back to the Palace and make thy face glad, and\\nput on the raiment that beseemeth a king, and with the crown of gold I\\nwill crown thee, and the sceptre of pearl will I place in thy hand.  And\\nas for thy dreams, think no more of them.  The burden of this world is\\ntoo great for one man to bear, and the world‚Äôs sorrow too heavy for one\\nheart to suffer.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòSayest thou that in this house?‚Äô said the young King, and he strode past\\nthe Bishop, and climbed up the steps of the altar, and stood before the\\nimage of Christ.\\n\\nHe stood before the image of Christ, and on his right hand and on his\\nleft were the marvellous vessels of gold, the chalice with the yellow\\nwine, and the vial with the holy oil.  He knelt before the image of\\nChrist, and the great candles burned brightly by the jewelled shrine, and\\nthe smoke of the incense curled in thin blue wreaths through the dome.\\nHe bowed his head in prayer, and the priests in their stiff copes crept\\naway from the altar.\\n\\nAnd suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside, and in entered\\nthe nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes, and shields of polished\\nsteel.  ‚ÄòWhere is this dreamer of dreams?‚Äô they cried.  ‚ÄòWhere is this\\nKing who is apparelled like a beggar‚Äîthis boy who brings shame upon our\\nstate?  Surely we will slay him, for he is unworthy to rule over us.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the young King bowed his head again, and prayed, and when he had\\nfinished his prayer he rose up, and turning round he looked at them\\nsadly.\\n\\nAnd lo! through the painted windows came the sunlight streaming upon him,\\nand the sun-beams wove round him a tissued robe that was fairer than the\\nrobe that had been fashioned for his pleasure.  The dead staff blossomed,\\nand bare lilies that were whiter than pearls.  The dry thorn blossomed,\\nand bare roses that were redder than rubies.  Whiter than fine pearls\\nwere the lilies, and their stems were of bright silver.  Redder than male\\nrubies were the roses, and their leaves were of beaten gold.\\n\\nHe stood there in the raiment of a king, and the gates of the jewelled\\nshrine flew open, and from the crystal of the many-rayed monstrance shone\\na marvellous and mystical light.  He stood there in a king‚Äôs raiment, and\\nthe Glory of God filled the place, and the saints in their carven niches\\nseemed to move.  In the fair raiment of a king he stood before them, and\\nthe organ pealed out its music, and the trumpeters blew upon their\\ntrumpets, and the singing boys sang.\\n\\nAnd the people fell upon their knees in awe, and the nobles sheathed\\ntheir swords and did homage, and the Bishop‚Äôs face grew pale, and his\\nhands trembled.  ‚ÄòA greater than I hath crowned thee,‚Äô he cried, and he\\nknelt before him.\\n\\nAnd the young King came down from the high altar, and passed home through\\nthe midst of the people.  But no man dared look upon his face, for it was\\nlike the face of an angel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE BIRTHDAY OF THE INFANTA\\n\\n\\n                                    TO\\n                         MRS. WILLIAM H. GRENFELL\\n                             OF TAPLOW COURT\\n                            [LADY DESBOROUGH]\\n\\nIT was the birthday of the Infanta.  She was just twelve years of age,\\nand the sun was shining brightly in the gardens of the palace.\\n\\nAlthough she was a real Princess and the Infanta of Spain, she had only\\none birthday every year, just like the children of quite poor people, so\\nit was naturally a matter of great importance to the whole country that\\nshe should have a really fine day for the occasion.  And a really fine\\nday it certainly was.  The tall striped tulips stood straight up upon\\ntheir stalks, like long rows of soldiers, and looked defiantly across the\\ngrass at the roses, and said: ‚ÄòWe are quite as splendid as you are now.‚Äô\\nThe purple butterflies fluttered about with gold dust on their wings,\\nvisiting each flower in turn; the little lizards crept out of the\\ncrevices of the wall, and lay basking in the white glare; and the\\npomegranates split and cracked with the heat, and showed their bleeding\\nred hearts.  Even the pale yellow lemons, that hung in such profusion\\nfrom the mouldering trellis and along the dim arcades, seemed to have\\ncaught a richer colour from the wonderful sunlight, and the magnolia\\ntrees opened their great globe-like blossoms of folded ivory, and filled\\nthe air with a sweet heavy perfume.\\n\\nThe little Princess herself walked up and down the terrace with her\\ncompanions, and played at hide and seek round the stone vases and the old\\nmoss-grown statues.  On ordinary days she was only allowed to play with\\nchildren of her own rank, so she had always to play alone, but her\\nbirthday was an exception, and the King had given orders that she was to\\ninvite any of her young friends whom she liked to come and amuse\\nthemselves with her.  There was a stately grace about these slim Spanish\\nchildren as they glided about, the boys with their large-plumed hats and\\nshort fluttering cloaks, the girls holding up the trains of their long\\nbrocaded gowns, and shielding the sun from their eyes with huge fans of\\nblack and silver.  But the Infanta was the most graceful of all, and the\\nmost tastefully attired, after the somewhat cumbrous fashion of the day.\\nHer robe was of grey satin, the skirt and the wide puffed sleeves heavily\\nembroidered with silver, and the stiff corset studded with rows of fine\\npearls.  Two tiny slippers with big pink rosettes peeped out beneath her\\ndress as she walked.  Pink and pearl was her great gauze fan, and in her\\nhair, which like an aureole of faded gold stood out stiffly round her\\npale little face, she had a beautiful white rose.\\n\\nFrom a window in the palace the sad melancholy King watched them.  Behind\\nhim stood his brother, Don Pedro of Aragon, whom he hated, and his\\nconfessor, the Grand Inquisitor of Granada, sat by his side.  Sadder even\\nthan usual was the King, for as he looked at the Infanta bowing with\\nchildish gravity to the assembling counters, or laughing behind her fan\\nat the grim Duchess of Albuquerque who always accompanied her, he thought\\nof the young Queen, her mother, who but a short time before‚Äîso it seemed\\nto him‚Äîhad come from the gay country of France, and had withered away in\\nthe sombre splendour of the Spanish court, dying just six months after\\nthe birth of her child, and before she had seen the almonds blossom twice\\nin the orchard, or plucked the second year‚Äôs fruit from the old gnarled\\nfig-tree that stood in the centre of the now grass-grown courtyard.  So\\ngreat had been his love for her that he had not suffered even the grave\\nto hide her from him.  She had been embalmed by a Moorish physician, who\\nin return for this service had been granted his life, which for heresy\\nand suspicion of magical practices had been already forfeited, men said,\\nto the Holy Office, and her body was still lying on its tapestried bier\\nin the black marble chapel of the Palace, just as the monks had borne her\\nin on that windy March day nearly twelve years before.  Once every month\\nthe King, wrapped in a dark cloak and with a muffled lantern in his hand,\\nwent in and knelt by her side calling out, ‚Äò_Mi reina_!  _Mi reina_!‚Äô and\\nsometimes breaking through the formal etiquette that in Spain governs\\nevery separate action of life, and sets limits even to the sorrow of a\\nKing, he would clutch at the pale jewelled hands in a wild agony of\\ngrief, and try to wake by his mad kisses the cold painted face.\\n\\nTo-day he seemed to see her again, as he had seen her first at the Castle\\nof Fontainebleau, when he was but fifteen years of age, and she still\\nyounger.  They had been formally betrothed on that occasion by the Papal\\nNuncio in the presence of the French King and all the Court, and he had\\nreturned to the Escurial bearing with him a little ringlet of yellow\\nhair, and the memory of two childish lips bending down to kiss his hand\\nas he stepped into his carriage.  Later on had followed the marriage,\\nhastily performed at Burgos, a small town on the frontier between the two\\ncountries, and the grand public entry into Madrid with the customary\\ncelebration of high mass at the Church of La Atocha, and a more than\\nusually solemn _auto-da-f√©_, in which nearly three hundred heretics,\\namongst whom were many Englishmen, had been delivered over to the secular\\narm to be burned.\\n\\nCertainly he had loved her madly, and to the ruin, many thought, of his\\ncountry, then at war with England for the possession of the empire of the\\nNew World.  He had hardly ever permitted her to be out of his sight; for\\nher, he had forgotten, or seemed to have forgotten, all grave affairs of\\nState; and, with that terrible blindness that passion brings upon its\\nservants, he had failed to notice that the elaborate ceremonies by which\\nhe sought to please her did but aggravate the strange malady from which\\nshe suffered.  When she died he was, for a time, like one bereft of\\nreason.  Indeed, there is no doubt but that he would have formally\\nabdicated and retired to the great Trappist monastery at Granada, of\\nwhich he was already titular Prior, had he not been afraid to leave the\\nlittle Infanta at the mercy of his brother, whose cruelty, even in Spain,\\nwas notorious, and who was suspected by many of having caused the Queen‚Äôs\\ndeath by means of a pair of poisoned gloves that he had presented to her\\non the occasion of her visiting his castle in Aragon.  Even after the\\nexpiration of the three years of public mourning that he had ordained\\nthroughout his whole dominions by royal edict, he would never suffer his\\nministers to speak about any new alliance, and when the Emperor himself\\nsent to him, and offered him the hand of the lovely Archduchess of\\nBohemia, his niece, in marriage, he bade the ambassadors tell their\\nmaster that the King of Spain was already wedded to Sorrow, and that\\nthough she was but a barren bride he loved her better than Beauty; an\\nanswer that cost his crown the rich provinces of the Netherlands, which\\nsoon after, at the Emperor‚Äôs instigation, revolted against him under the\\nleadership of some fanatics of the Reformed Church.\\n\\nHis whole married life, with its fierce, fiery-coloured joys and the\\nterrible agony of its sudden ending, seemed to come back to him to-day as\\nhe watched the Infanta playing on the terrace.  She had all the Queen‚Äôs\\npretty petulance of manner, the same wilful way of tossing her head, the\\nsame proud curved beautiful mouth, the same wonderful smile‚Äî_vrai sourire\\nde France_ indeed‚Äîas she glanced up now and then at the window, or\\nstretched out her little hand for the stately Spanish gentlemen to kiss.\\nBut the shrill laughter of the children grated on his ears, and the\\nbright pitiless sunlight mocked his sorrow, and a dull odour of strange\\nspices, spices such as embalmers use, seemed to taint‚Äîor was it\\nfancy?‚Äîthe clear morning air.  He buried his face in his hands, and when\\nthe Infanta looked up again the curtains had been drawn, and the King had\\nretired.\\n\\nShe made a little _moue_ of disappointment, and shrugged her shoulders.\\nSurely he might have stayed with her on her birthday.  What did the\\nstupid State-affairs matter?  Or had he gone to that gloomy chapel, where\\nthe candles were always burning, and where she was never allowed to\\nenter?  How silly of him, when the sun was shining so brightly, and\\neverybody was so happy!  Besides, he would miss the sham bull-fight for\\nwhich the trumpet was already sounding, to say nothing of the puppet-show\\nand the other wonderful things.  Her uncle and the Grand Inquisitor were\\nmuch more sensible.  They had come out on the terrace, and paid her nice\\ncompliments.  So she tossed her pretty head, and taking Don Pedro by the\\nhand, she walked slowly down the steps towards a long pavilion of purple\\nsilk that had been erected at the end of the garden, the other children\\nfollowing in strict order of precedence, those who had the longest names\\ngoing first.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nA procession of noble boys, fantastically dressed as _toreadors_, came\\nout to meet her, and the young Count of Tierra-Nueva, a wonderfully\\nhandsome lad of about fourteen years of age, uncovering his head with all\\nthe grace of a born hidalgo and grandee of Spain, led her solemnly in to\\na little gilt and ivory chair that was placed on a raised dais above the\\narena.  The children grouped themselves all round, fluttering their big\\nfans and whispering to each other, and Don Pedro and the Grand Inquisitor\\nstood laughing at the entrance.  Even the Duchess‚Äîthe Camerera-Mayor as\\nshe was called‚Äîa thin, hard-featured woman with a yellow ruff, did not\\nlook quite so bad-tempered as usual, and something like a chill smile\\nflitted across her wrinkled face and twitched her thin bloodless lips.\\n\\nIt certainly was a marvellous bull-fight, and much nicer, the Infanta\\nthought, than the real bull-fight that she had been brought to see at\\nSeville, on the occasion of the visit of the Duke of Parma to her father.\\nSome of the boys pranced about on richly-caparisoned hobby-horses\\nbrandishing long javelins with gay streamers of bright ribands attached\\nto them; others went on foot waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull,\\nand vaulting lightly over the barrier when he charged them; and as for\\nthe bull himself, he was just like a live bull, though he was only made\\nof wicker-work and stretched hide, and sometimes insisted on running\\nround the arena on his hind legs, which no live bull ever dreams of\\ndoing.  He made a splendid fight of it too, and the children got so\\nexcited that they stood up upon the benches, and waved their lace\\nhandkerchiefs and cried out: _Bravo toro_!  _Bravo toro_! just as\\nsensibly as if they had been grown-up people.  At last, however, after a\\nprolonged combat, during which several of the hobby-horses were gored\\nthrough and through, and, their riders dismounted, the young Count of\\nTierra-Nueva brought the bull to his knees, and having obtained\\npermission from the Infanta to give the _coup de gr√¢ce_, he plunged his\\nwooden sword into the neck of the animal with such violence that the head\\ncame right off, and disclosed the laughing face of little Monsieur de\\nLorraine, the son of the French Ambassador at Madrid.\\n\\nThe arena was then cleared amidst much applause, and the dead\\nhobby-horses dragged solemnly away by two Moorish pages in yellow and\\nblack liveries, and after a short interlude, during which a French\\nposture-master performed upon the tightrope, some Italian puppets\\nappeared in the semi-classical tragedy of _Sophonisba_ on the stage of a\\nsmall theatre that had been built up for the purpose.  They acted so\\nwell, and their gestures were so extremely natural, that at the close of\\nthe play the eyes of the Infanta were quite dim with tears.  Indeed some\\nof the children really cried, and had to be comforted with sweetmeats,\\nand the Grand Inquisitor himself was so affected that he could not help\\nsaying to Don Pedro that it seemed to him intolerable that things made\\nsimply out of wood and coloured wax, and worked mechanically by wires,\\nshould be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunes.\\n\\nAn African juggler followed, who brought in a large flat basket covered\\nwith a red cloth, and having placed it in the centre of the arena, he\\ntook from his turban a curious reed pipe, and blew through it.  In a few\\nmoments the cloth began to move, and as the pipe grew shriller and\\nshriller two green and gold snakes put out their strange wedge-shaped\\nheads and rose slowly up, swaying to and fro with the music as a plant\\nsways in the water.  The children, however, were rather frightened at\\ntheir spotted hoods and quick darting tongues, and were much more pleased\\nwhen the juggler made a tiny orange-tree grow out of the sand and bear\\npretty white blossoms and clusters of real fruit; and when he took the\\nfan of the little daughter of the Marquess de Las-Torres, and changed it\\ninto a blue bird that flew all round the pavilion and sang, their delight\\nand amazement knew no bounds.  The solemn minuet, too, performed by the\\ndancing boys from the church of Nuestra Senora Del Pilar, was charming.\\nThe Infanta had never before seen this wonderful ceremony which takes\\nplace every year at Maytime in front of the high altar of the Virgin, and\\nin her honour; and indeed none of the royal family of Spain had entered\\nthe great cathedral of Saragossa since a mad priest, supposed by many to\\nhave been in the pay of Elizabeth of England, had tried to administer a\\npoisoned wafer to the Prince of the Asturias.  So she had known only by\\nhearsay of ‚ÄòOur Lady‚Äôs Dance,‚Äô as it was called, and it certainly was a\\nbeautiful sight.  The boys wore old-fashioned court dresses of white\\nvelvet, and their curious three-cornered hats were fringed with silver\\nand surmounted with huge plumes of ostrich feathers, the dazzling\\nwhiteness of their costumes, as they moved about in the sunlight, being\\nstill more accentuated by their swarthy faces and long black hair.\\nEverybody was fascinated by the grave dignity with which they moved\\nthrough the intricate figures of the dance, and by the elaborate grace of\\ntheir slow gestures, and stately bows, and when they had finished their\\nperformance and doffed their great plumed hats to the Infanta, she\\nacknowledged their reverence with much courtesy, and made a vow that she\\nwould send a large wax candle to the shrine of Our Lady of Pilar in\\nreturn for the pleasure that she had given her.\\n\\nA troop of handsome Egyptians‚Äîas the gipsies were termed in those\\ndays‚Äîthen advanced into the arena, and sitting down cross-legs, in a\\ncircle, began to play softly upon their zithers, moving their bodies to\\nthe tune, and humming, almost below their breath, a low dreamy air.  When\\nthey caught sight of Don Pedro they scowled at him, and some of them\\nlooked terrified, for only a few weeks before he had had two of their\\ntribe hanged for sorcery in the market-place at Seville, but the pretty\\nInfanta charmed them as she leaned back peeping over her fan with her\\ngreat blue eyes, and they felt sure that one so lovely as she was could\\nnever be cruel to anybody.  So they played on very gently and just\\ntouching the cords of the zithers with their long pointed nails, and\\ntheir heads began to nod as though they were falling asleep.  Suddenly,\\nwith a cry so shrill that all the children were startled and Don Pedro‚Äôs\\nhand clutched at the agate pommel of his dagger, they leapt to their feet\\nand whirled madly round the enclosure beating their tambourines, and\\nchaunting some wild love-song in their strange guttural language.  Then\\nat another signal they all flung themselves again to the ground and lay\\nthere quite still, the dull strumming of the zithers being the only sound\\nthat broke the silence.  After that they had done this several times,\\nthey disappeared for a moment and came back leading a brown shaggy bear\\nby a chain, and carrying on their shoulders some little Barbary apes.\\nThe bear stood upon his head with the utmost gravity, and the wizened\\napes played all kinds of amusing tricks with two gipsy boys who seemed to\\nbe their masters, and fought with tiny swords, and fired off guns, and\\nwent through a regular soldier‚Äôs drill just like the King‚Äôs own\\nbodyguard.  In fact the gipsies were a great success.\\n\\nBut the funniest part of the whole morning‚Äôs entertainment, was\\nundoubtedly the dancing of the little Dwarf.  When he stumbled into the\\narena, waddling on his crooked legs and wagging his huge misshapen head\\nfrom side to side, the children went off into a loud shout of delight,\\nand the Infanta herself laughed so much that the Camerera was obliged to\\nremind her that although there were many precedents in Spain for a King‚Äôs\\ndaughter weeping before her equals, there were none for a Princess of the\\nblood royal making so merry before those who were her inferiors in birth.\\nThe Dwarf, however, was really quite irresistible, and even at the\\nSpanish Court, always noted for its cultivated passion for the horrible,\\nso fantastic a little monster had never been seen.  It was his first\\nappearance, too.  He had been discovered only the day before, running\\nwild through the forest, by two of the nobles who happened to have been\\nhunting in a remote part of the great cork-wood that surrounded the town,\\nand had been carried off by them to the Palace as a surprise for the\\nInfanta; his father, who was a poor charcoal-burner, being but too well\\npleased to get rid of so ugly and useless a child.  Perhaps the most\\namusing thing about him was his complete unconsciousness of his own\\ngrotesque appearance.  Indeed he seemed quite happy and full of the\\nhighest spirits.  When the children laughed, he laughed as freely and as\\njoyously as any of them, and at the close of each dance he made them each\\nthe funniest of bows, smiling and nodding at them just as if he was\\nreally one of themselves, and not a little misshapen thing that Nature,\\nin some humourous mood, had fashioned for others to mock at.  As for the\\nInfanta, she absolutely fascinated him.  He could not keep his eyes off\\nher, and seemed to dance for her alone, and when at the close of the\\nperformance, remembering how she had seen the great ladies of the Court\\nthrow bouquets to Caffarelli, the famous Italian treble, whom the Pope\\nhad sent from his own chapel to Madrid that he might cure the King‚Äôs\\nmelancholy by the sweetness of his voice, she took out of her hair the\\nbeautiful white rose, and partly for a jest and partly to tease the\\nCamerera, threw it to him across the arena with her sweetest smile, he\\ntook the whole matter quite seriously, and pressing the flower to his\\nrough coarse lips he put his hand upon his heart, and sank on one knee\\nbefore her, grinning from ear to ear, and with his little bright eyes\\nsparkling with pleasure.\\n\\nThis so upset the gravity of the Infanta that she kept on laughing long\\nafter the little Dwarf had ran out of the arena, and expressed a desire\\nto her uncle that the dance should be immediately repeated.  The\\nCamerera, however, on the plea that the sun was too hot, decided that it\\nwould be better that her Highness should return without delay to the\\nPalace, where a wonderful feast had been already prepared for her,\\nincluding a real birthday cake with her own initials worked all over it\\nin painted sugar and a lovely silver flag waving from the top.  The\\nInfanta accordingly rose up with much dignity, and having given orders\\nthat the little dwarf was to dance again for her after the hour of\\nsiesta, and conveyed her thanks to the young Count of Tierra-Nueva for\\nhis charming reception, she went back to her apartments, the children\\nfollowing in the same order in which they had entered.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nNow when the little Dwarf heard that he was to dance a second time before\\nthe Infanta, and by her own express command, he was so proud that he ran\\nout into the garden, kissing the white rose in an absurd ecstasy of\\npleasure, and making the most uncouth and clumsy gestures of delight.\\n\\nThe Flowers were quite indignant at his daring to intrude into their\\nbeautiful home, and when they saw him capering up and down the walks, and\\nwaving his arms above his head in such a ridiculous manner, they could\\nnot restrain their feelings any longer.\\n\\n‚ÄòHe is really far too ugly to be allowed to play in any place where we\\nare,‚Äô cried the Tulips.\\n\\n‚ÄòHe should drink poppy-juice, and go to sleep for a thousand years,‚Äô said\\nthe great scarlet Lilies, and they grew quite hot and angry.\\n\\n‚ÄòHe is a perfect horror!‚Äô screamed the Cactus.  ‚ÄòWhy, he is twisted and\\nstumpy, and his head is completely out of proportion with his legs.\\nReally he makes me feel prickly all over, and if he comes near me I will\\nsting him with my thorns.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd he has actually got one of my best blooms,‚Äô exclaimed the White\\nRose-Tree.  ‚ÄòI gave it to the Infanta this morning myself, as a birthday\\npresent, and he has stolen it from her.‚Äô  And she called out: ‚ÄòThief,\\nthief, thief!‚Äô at the top of her voice.\\n\\nEven the red Geraniums, who did not usually give themselves airs, and\\nwere known to have a great many poor relations themselves, curled up in\\ndisgust when they saw him, and when the Violets meekly remarked that\\nthough he was certainly extremely plain, still he could not help it, they\\nretorted with a good deal of justice that that was his chief defect, and\\nthat there was no reason why one should admire a person because he was\\nincurable; and, indeed, some of the Violets themselves felt that the\\nugliness of the little Dwarf was almost ostentatious, and that he would\\nhave shown much better taste if he had looked sad, or at least pensive,\\ninstead of jumping about merrily, and throwing himself into such\\ngrotesque and silly attitudes.\\n\\nAs for the old Sundial, who was an extremely remarkable individual, and\\nhad once told the time of day to no less a person than the Emperor\\nCharles V. himself, he was so taken aback by the little Dwarf‚Äôs\\nappearance, that he almost forgot to mark two whole minutes with his long\\nshadowy finger, and could not help saying to the great milk-white\\nPeacock, who was sunning herself on the balustrade, that every one knew\\nthat the children of Kings were Kings, and that the children of\\ncharcoal-burners were charcoal-burners, and that it was absurd to pretend\\nthat it wasn‚Äôt so; a statement with which the Peacock entirely agreed,\\nand indeed screamed out, ‚ÄòCertainly, certainly,‚Äô in such a loud, harsh\\nvoice, that the gold-fish who lived in the basin of the cool splashing\\nfountain put their heads out of the water, and asked the huge stone\\nTritons what on earth was the matter.\\n\\nBut somehow the Birds liked him.  They had seen him often in the forest,\\ndancing about like an elf after the eddying leaves, or crouched up in the\\nhollow of some old oak-tree, sharing his nuts with the squirrels.  They\\ndid not mind his being ugly, a bit.  Why, even the nightingale herself,\\nwho sang so sweetly in the orange groves at night that sometimes the Moon\\nleaned down to listen, was not much to look at after all; and, besides,\\nhe had been kind to them, and during that terribly bitter winter, when\\nthere were no berries on the trees, and the ground was as hard as iron,\\nand the wolves had come down to the very gates of the city to look for\\nfood, he had never once forgotten them, but had always given them crumbs\\nout of his little hunch of black bread, and divided with them whatever\\npoor breakfast he had.\\n\\nSo they flew round and round him, just touching his cheek with their\\nwings as they passed, and chattered to each other, and the little Dwarf\\nwas so pleased that he could not help showing them the beautiful white\\nrose, and telling them that the Infanta herself had given it to him\\nbecause she loved him.\\n\\nThey did not understand a single word of what he was saying, but that\\nmade no matter, for they put their heads on one side, and looked wise,\\nwhich is quite as good as understanding a thing, and very much easier.\\n\\nThe Lizards also took an immense fancy to him, and when he grew tired of\\nrunning about and flung himself down on the grass to rest, they played\\nand romped all over him, and tried to amuse him in the best way they\\ncould.  ‚ÄòEvery one cannot be as beautiful as a lizard,‚Äô they cried; ‚Äòthat\\nwould be too much to expect.  And, though it sounds absurd to say so, he\\nis really not so ugly after all, provided, of course, that one shuts\\none‚Äôs eyes, and does not look at him.‚Äô  The Lizards were extremely\\nphilosophical by nature, and often sat thinking for hours and hours\\ntogether, when there was nothing else to do, or when the weather was too\\nrainy for them to go out.\\n\\nThe Flowers, however, were excessively annoyed at their behaviour, and at\\nthe behaviour of the birds.  ‚ÄòIt only shows,‚Äô they said, ‚Äòwhat a\\nvulgarising effect this incessant rushing and flying about has.\\nWell-bred people always stay exactly in the same place, as we do.  No one\\never saw us hopping up and down the walks, or galloping madly through the\\ngrass after dragon-flies.  When we do want change of air, we send for the\\ngardener, and he carries us to another bed.  This is dignified, and as it\\nshould be.  But birds and lizards have no sense of repose, and indeed\\nbirds have not even a permanent address.  They are mere vagrants like the\\ngipsies, and should be treated in exactly the same manner.‚Äô  So they put\\ntheir noses in the air, and looked very haughty, and were quite delighted\\nwhen after some time they saw the little Dwarf scramble up from the\\ngrass, and make his way across the terrace to the palace.\\n\\n‚ÄòHe should certainly be kept indoors for the rest of his natural life,‚Äô\\nthey said.  ‚ÄòLook at his hunched back, and his crooked legs,‚Äô and they\\nbegan to titter.\\n\\nBut the little Dwarf knew nothing of all this.  He liked the birds and\\nthe lizards immensely, and thought that the flowers were the most\\nmarvellous things in the whole world, except of course the Infanta, but\\nthen she had given him the beautiful white rose, and she loved him, and\\nthat made a great difference.  How he wished that he had gone back with\\nher!  She would have put him on her right hand, and smiled at him, and he\\nwould have never left her side, but would have made her his playmate, and\\ntaught her all kinds of delightful tricks.  For though he had never been\\nin a palace before, he knew a great many wonderful things.  He could make\\nlittle cages out of rushes for the grasshoppers to sing in, and fashion\\nthe long jointed bamboo into the pipe that Pan loves to hear.  He knew\\nthe cry of every bird, and could call the starlings from the tree-top, or\\nthe heron from the mere.  He knew the trail of every animal, and could\\ntrack the hare by its delicate footprints, and the boar by the trampled\\nleaves.  All the wild-dances he knew, the mad dance in red raiment with\\nthe autumn, the light dance in blue sandals over the corn, the dance with\\nwhite snow-wreaths in winter, and the blossom-dance through the orchards\\nin spring.  He knew where the wood-pigeons built their nests, and once\\nwhen a fowler had snared the parent birds, he had brought up the young\\nones himself, and had built a little dovecot for them in the cleft of a\\npollard elm.  They were quite tame, and used to feed out of his hands\\nevery morning.  She would like them, and the rabbits that scurried about\\nin the long fern, and the jays with their steely feathers and black\\nbills, and the hedgehogs that could curl themselves up into prickly\\nballs, and the great wise tortoises that crawled slowly about, shaking\\ntheir heads and nibbling at the young leaves.  Yes, she must certainly\\ncome to the forest and play with him.  He would give her his own little\\nbed, and would watch outside the window till dawn, to see that the wild\\nhorned cattle did not harm her, nor the gaunt wolves creep too near the\\nhut.  And at dawn he would tap at the shutters and wake her, and they\\nwould go out and dance together all the day long.  It was really not a\\nbit lonely in the forest.  Sometimes a Bishop rode through on his white\\nmule, reading out of a painted book.  Sometimes in their green velvet\\ncaps, and their jerkins of tanned deerskin, the falconers passed by, with\\nhooded hawks on their wrists.  At vintage-time came the grape-treaders,\\nwith purple hands and feet, wreathed with glossy ivy and carrying\\ndripping skins of wine; and the charcoal-burners sat round their huge\\nbraziers at night, watching the dry logs charring slowly in the fire, and\\nroasting chestnuts in the ashes, and the robbers came out of their caves\\nand made merry with them.  Once, too, he had seen a beautiful procession\\nwinding up the long dusty road to Toledo.  The monks went in front\\nsinging sweetly, and carrying bright banners and crosses of gold, and\\nthen, in silver armour, with matchlocks and pikes, came the soldiers, and\\nin their midst walked three barefooted men, in strange yellow dresses\\npainted all over with wonderful figures, and carrying lighted candles in\\ntheir hands.  Certainly there was a great deal to look at in the forest,\\nand when she was tired he would find a soft bank of moss for her, or\\ncarry her in his arms, for he was very strong, though he knew that he was\\nnot tall.  He would make her a necklace of red bryony berries, that would\\nbe quite as pretty as the white berries that she wore on her dress, and\\nwhen she was tired of them, she could throw them away, and he would find\\nher others.  He would bring her acorn-cups and dew-drenched anemones, and\\ntiny glow-worms to be stars in the pale gold of her hair.\\n\\nBut where was she?  He asked the white rose, and it made him no answer.\\nThe whole palace seemed asleep, and even where the shutters had not been\\nclosed, heavy curtains had been drawn across the windows to keep out the\\nglare.  He wandered all round looking for some place through which he\\nmight gain an entrance, and at last he caught sight of a little private\\ndoor that was lying open.  He slipped through, and found himself in a\\nsplendid hall, far more splendid, he feared, than the forest, there was\\nso much more gilding everywhere, and even the floor was made of great\\ncoloured stones, fitted together into a sort of geometrical pattern.  But\\nthe little Infanta was not there, only some wonderful white statues that\\nlooked down on him from their jasper pedestals, with sad blank eyes and\\nstrangely smiling lips.\\n\\nAt the end of the hall hung a richly embroidered curtain of black velvet,\\npowdered with suns and stars, the King‚Äôs favourite devices, and broidered\\non the colour he loved best.  Perhaps she was hiding behind that?  He\\nwould try at any rate.\\n\\nSo he stole quietly across, and drew it aside.  No; there was only\\nanother room, though a prettier room, he thought, than the one he had\\njust left.  The walls were hung with a many-figured green arras of\\nneedle-wrought tapestry representing a hunt, the work of some Flemish\\nartists who had spent more than seven years in its composition.  It had\\nonce been the chamber of _Jean le Fou_, as he was called, that mad King\\nwho was so enamoured of the chase, that he had often tried in his\\ndelirium to mount the huge rearing horses, and to drag down the stag on\\nwhich the great hounds were leaping, sounding his hunting horn, and\\nstabbing with his dagger at the pale flying deer.  It was now used as the\\ncouncil-room, and on the centre table were lying the red portfolios of\\nthe ministers, stamped with the gold tulips of Spain, and with the arms\\nand emblems of the house of Hapsburg.\\n\\nThe little Dwarf looked in wonder all round him, and was half-afraid to\\ngo on.  The strange silent horsemen that galloped so swiftly through the\\nlong glades without making any noise, seemed to him like those terrible\\nphantoms of whom he had heard the charcoal-burners speaking‚Äîthe\\nComprachos, who hunt only at night, and if they meet a man, turn him into\\na hind, and chase him.  But he thought of the pretty Infanta, and took\\ncourage.  He wanted to find her alone, and to tell her that he too loved\\nher.  Perhaps she was in the room beyond.\\n\\nHe ran across the soft Moorish carpets, and opened the door.  No!  She\\nwas not here either.  The room was quite empty.\\n\\nIt was a throne-room, used for the reception of foreign ambassadors, when\\nthe King, which of late had not been often, consented to give them a\\npersonal audience; the same room in which, many years before, envoys had\\nappeared from England to make arrangements for the marriage of their\\nQueen, then one of the Catholic sovereigns of Europe, with the Emperor‚Äôs\\neldest son.  The hangings were of gilt Cordovan leather, and a heavy gilt\\nchandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the\\nblack and white ceiling.  Underneath a great canopy of gold cloth, on\\nwhich the lions and towers of Castile were broidered in seed pearls,\\nstood the throne itself, covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded\\nwith silver tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls.  On\\nthe second step of the throne was placed the kneeling-stool of the\\nInfanta, with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue, and below that\\nagain, and beyond the limit of the canopy, stood the chair for the Papal\\nNuncio, who alone had the right to be seated in the King‚Äôs presence on\\nthe occasion of any public ceremonial, and whose Cardinal‚Äôs hat, with its\\ntangled scarlet tassels, lay on a purple _tabouret_ in front.  On the\\nwall, facing the throne, hung a life-sized portrait of Charles V. in\\nhunting dress, with a great mastiff by his side, and a picture of Philip\\nII. receiving the homage of the Netherlands occupied the centre of the\\nother wall.  Between the windows stood a black ebony cabinet, inlaid with\\nplates of ivory, on which the figures from Holbein‚Äôs Dance of Death had\\nbeen graved‚Äîby the hand, some said, of that famous master himself.\\n\\nBut the little Dwarf cared nothing for all this magnificence.  He would\\nnot have given his rose for all the pearls on the canopy, nor one white\\npetal of his rose for the throne itself.  What he wanted was to see the\\nInfanta before she went down to the pavilion, and to ask her to come away\\nwith him when he had finished his dance.  Here, in the Palace, the air\\nwas close and heavy, but in the forest the wind blew free, and the\\nsunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves aside.\\nThere were flowers, too, in the forest, not so splendid, perhaps, as the\\nflowers in the garden, but more sweetly scented for all that; hyacinths\\nin early spring that flooded with waving purple the cool glens, and\\ngrassy knolls; yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round the\\ngnarled roots of the oak-trees; bright celandine, and blue speedwell, and\\nirises lilac and gold.  There were grey catkins on the hazels, and the\\nfoxgloves drooped with the weight of their dappled bee-haunted cells.\\nThe chestnut had its spires of white stars, and the hawthorn its pallid\\nmoons of beauty.  Yes: surely she would come if he could only find her!\\nShe would come with him to the fair forest, and all day long he would\\ndance for her delight.  A smile lit up his eyes at the thought, and he\\npassed into the next room.\\n\\nOf all the rooms this was the brightest and the most beautiful.  The\\nwalls were covered with a pink-flowered Lucca damask, patterned with\\nbirds and dotted with dainty blossoms of silver; the furniture was of\\nmassive silver, festooned with florid wreaths, and swinging Cupids; in\\nfront of the two large fire-places stood great screens broidered with\\nparrots and peacocks, and the floor, which was of sea-green onyx, seemed\\nto stretch far away into the distance.  Nor was he alone.  Standing under\\nthe shadow of the doorway, at the extreme end of the room, he saw a\\nlittle figure watching him.  His heart trembled, a cry of joy broke from\\nhis lips, and he moved out into the sunlight.  As he did so, the figure\\nmoved out also, and he saw it plainly.\\n\\nThe Infanta!  It was a monster, the most grotesque monster he had ever\\nbeheld.  Not properly shaped, as all other people were, but hunchbacked,\\nand crooked-limbed, with huge lolling head and mane of black hair.  The\\nlittle Dwarf frowned, and the monster frowned also.  He laughed, and it\\nlaughed with him, and held its hands to its sides, just as he himself was\\ndoing.  He made it a mocking bow, and it returned him a low reverence.\\nHe went towards it, and it came to meet him, copying each step that he\\nmade, and stopping when he stopped himself.  He shouted with amusement,\\nand ran forward, and reached out his hand, and the hand of the monster\\ntouched his, and it was as cold as ice.  He grew afraid, and moved his\\nhand across, and the monster‚Äôs hand followed it quickly.  He tried to\\npress on, but something smooth and hard stopped him.  The face of the\\nmonster was now close to his own, and seemed full of terror.  He brushed\\nhis hair off his eyes.  It imitated him.  He struck at it, and it\\nreturned blow for blow.  He loathed it, and it made hideous faces at him.\\nHe drew back, and it retreated.\\n\\nWhat is it?  He thought for a moment, and looked round at the rest of the\\nroom.  It was strange, but everything seemed to have its double in this\\ninvisible wall of clear water.  Yes, picture for picture was repeated,\\nand couch for couch.  The sleeping Faun that lay in the alcove by the\\ndoorway had its twin brother that slumbered, and the silver Venus that\\nstood in the sunlight held out her arms to a Venus as lovely as herself.\\n\\nWas it Echo?  He had called to her once in the valley, and she had\\nanswered him word for word.  Could she mock the eye, as she mocked the\\nvoice?  Could she make a mimic world just like the real world?  Could the\\nshadows of things have colour and life and movement?  Could it be that‚Äî?\\n\\nHe started, and taking from his breast the beautiful white rose, he\\nturned round, and kissed it.  The monster had a rose of its own, petal\\nfor petal the same!  It kissed it with like kisses, and pressed it to its\\nheart with horrible gestures.\\n\\nWhen the truth dawned upon him, he gave a wild cry of despair, and fell\\nsobbing to the ground.  So it was he who was misshapen and hunchbacked,\\nfoul to look at and grotesque.  He himself was the monster, and it was at\\nhim that all the children had been laughing, and the little Princess who\\nhe had thought loved him‚Äîshe too had been merely mocking at his ugliness,\\nand making merry over his twisted limbs.  Why had they not left him in\\nthe forest, where there was no mirror to tell him how loathsome he was?\\nWhy had his father not killed him, rather than sell him to his shame?\\nThe hot tears poured down his cheeks, and he tore the white rose to\\npieces.  The sprawling monster did the same, and scattered the faint\\npetals in the air.  It grovelled on the ground, and, when he looked at\\nit, it watched him with a face drawn with pain.  He crept away, lest he\\nshould see it, and covered his eyes with his hands.  He crawled, like\\nsome wounded thing, into the shadow, and lay there moaning.\\n\\nAnd at that moment the Infanta herself came in with her companions\\nthrough the open window, and when they saw the ugly little dwarf lying on\\nthe ground and beating the floor with his clenched hands, in the most\\nfantastic and exaggerated manner, they went off into shouts of happy\\nlaughter, and stood all round him and watched him.\\n\\n‚ÄòHis dancing was funny,‚Äô said the Infanta; ‚Äòbut his acting is funnier\\nstill.  Indeed he is almost as good as the puppets, only of course not\\nquite so natural.‚Äô  And she fluttered her big fan, and applauded.\\n\\nBut the little Dwarf never looked up, and his sobs grew fainter and\\nfainter, and suddenly he gave a curious gasp, and clutched his side.  And\\nthen he fell back again, and lay quite still.\\n\\n‚ÄòThat is capital,‚Äô said the Infanta, after a pause; ‚Äòbut now you must\\ndance for me.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòYes,‚Äô cried all the children, ‚Äòyou must get up and dance, for you are as\\nclever as the Barbary apes, and much more ridiculous.‚Äô  But the little\\nDwarf made no answer.\\n\\nAnd the Infanta stamped her foot, and called out to her uncle, who was\\nwalking on the terrace with the Chamberlain, reading some despatches that\\nhad just arrived from Mexico, where the Holy Office had recently been\\nestablished.  ‚ÄòMy funny little dwarf is sulking,‚Äô she cried, ‚Äòyou must\\nwake him up, and tell him to dance for me.‚Äô\\n\\nThey smiled at each other, and sauntered in, and Don Pedro stooped down,\\nand slapped the Dwarf on the cheek with his embroidered glove.  ‚ÄòYou must\\ndance,‚Äô he said, ‚Äò_petit monsire_.  You must dance.  The Infanta of Spain\\nand the Indies wishes to be amused.‚Äô\\n\\nBut the little Dwarf never moved.\\n\\n‚ÄòA whipping master should be sent for,‚Äô said Don Pedro wearily, and he\\nwent back to the terrace.  But the Chamberlain looked grave, and he knelt\\nbeside the little dwarf, and put his hand upon his heart.  And after a\\nfew moments he shrugged his shoulders, and rose up, and having made a low\\nbow to the Infanta, he said‚Äî\\n\\n‚Äò_Mi bella Princesa_, your funny little dwarf will never dance again.  It\\nis a pity, for he is so ugly that he might have made the King smile.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòBut why will he not dance again?‚Äô asked the Infanta, laughing.\\n\\n‚ÄòBecause his heart is broken,‚Äô answered the Chamberlain.\\n\\nAnd the Infanta frowned, and her dainty rose-leaf lips curled in pretty\\ndisdain.  ‚ÄòFor the future let those who come to play with me have no\\nhearts,‚Äô she cried, and she ran out into the garden.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE FISHERMAN AND HIS SOUL\\n\\n\\n                                TO H.S.H.\\n                             ALICE, PRINCESS\\n                                OF MONACO\\n\\nEVERY evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and threw his\\nnets into the water.\\n\\nWhen the wind blew from the land he caught nothing, or but little at\\nbest, for it was a bitter and black-winged wind, and rough waves rose up\\nto meet it.  But when the wind blew to the shore, the fish came in from\\nthe deep, and swam into the meshes of his nets, and he took them to the\\nmarket-place and sold them.\\n\\nEvery evening he went out upon the sea, and one evening the net was so\\nheavy that hardly could he draw it into the boat.  And he laughed, and\\nsaid to himself, ‚ÄòSurely I have caught all the fish that swim, or snared\\nsome dull monster that will be a marvel to men, or some thing of horror\\nthat the great Queen will desire,‚Äô and putting forth all his strength, he\\ntugged at the coarse ropes till, like lines of blue enamel round a vase\\nof bronze, the long veins rose up on his arms.  He tugged at the thin\\nropes, and nearer and nearer came the circle of flat corks, and the net\\nrose at last to the top of the water.\\n\\nBut no fish at all was in it, nor any monster or thing of horror, but\\nonly a little Mermaid lying fast asleep.\\n\\nHer hair was as a wet fleece of gold, and each separate hair as a thread\\nof fine gold in a cup of glass.  Her body was as white ivory, and her\\ntail was of silver and pearl.  Silver and pearl was her tail, and the\\ngreen weeds of the sea coiled round it; and like sea-shells were her\\nears, and her lips were like sea-coral.  The cold waves dashed over her\\ncold breasts, and the salt glistened upon her eyelids.\\n\\nSo beautiful was she that when the young Fisherman saw her he was filled\\nwith wonder, and he put out his hand and drew the net close to him, and\\nleaning over the side he clasped her in his arms.  And when he touched\\nher, she gave a cry like a startled sea-gull, and woke, and looked at him\\nin terror with her mauve-amethyst eyes, and struggled that she might\\nescape.  But he held her tightly to him, and would not suffer her to\\ndepart.\\n\\nAnd when she saw that she could in no way escape from him, she began to\\nweep, and said, ‚ÄòI pray thee let me go, for I am the only daughter of a\\nKing, and my father is aged and alone.‚Äô\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman answered, ‚ÄòI will not let thee go save thou\\nmakest me a promise that whenever I call thee, thou wilt come and sing to\\nme, for the fish delight to listen to the song of the Sea-folk, and so\\nshall my nets be full.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòWilt thou in very truth let me go, if I promise thee this?‚Äô cried the\\nMermaid.\\n\\n‚ÄòIn very truth I will let thee go,‚Äô said the young Fisherman.\\n\\nSo she made him the promise he desired, and sware it by the oath of the\\nSea-folk.  And he loosened his arms from about her, and she sank down\\ninto the water, trembling with a strange fear.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nEvery evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and called to\\nthe Mermaid, and she rose out of the water and sang to him.  Round and\\nround her swam the dolphins, and the wild gulls wheeled above her head.\\n\\nAnd she sang a marvellous song.  For she sang of the Sea-folk who drive\\ntheir flocks from cave to cave, and carry the little calves on their\\nshoulders; of the Tritons who have long green beards, and hairy breasts,\\nand blow through twisted conchs when the King passes by; of the palace of\\nthe King which is all of amber, with a roof of clear emerald, and a\\npavement of bright pearl; and of the gardens of the sea where the great\\nfiligrane fans of coral wave all day long, and the fish dart about like\\nsilver birds, and the anemones cling to the rocks, and the pinks bourgeon\\nin the ribbed yellow sand.  She sang of the big whales that come down\\nfrom the north seas and have sharp icicles hanging to their fins; of the\\nSirens who tell of such wonderful things that the merchants have to stop\\ntheir ears with wax lest they should hear them, and leap into the water\\nand be drowned; of the sunken galleys with their tall masts, and the\\nfrozen sailors clinging to the rigging, and the mackerel swimming in and\\nout of the open portholes; of the little barnacles who are great\\ntravellers, and cling to the keels of the ships and go round and round\\nthe world; and of the cuttlefish who live in the sides of the cliffs and\\nstretch out their long black arms, and can make night come when they will\\nit.  She sang of the nautilus who has a boat of her own that is carved\\nout of an opal and steered with a silken sail; of the happy Mermen who\\nplay upon harps and can charm the great Kraken to sleep; of the little\\nchildren who catch hold of the slippery porpoises and ride laughing upon\\ntheir backs; of the Mermaids who lie in the white foam and hold out their\\narms to the mariners; and of the sea-lions with their curved tusks, and\\nthe sea-horses with their floating manes.\\n\\nAnd as she sang, all the tunny-fish came in from the deep to listen to\\nher, and the young Fisherman threw his nets round them and caught them,\\nand others he took with a spear.  And when his boat was well-laden, the\\nMermaid would sink down into the sea, smiling at him.\\n\\nYet would she never come near him that he might touch her.  Oftentimes he\\ncalled to her and prayed of her, but she would not; and when he sought to\\nseize her she dived into the water as a seal might dive, nor did he see\\nher again that day.  And each day the sound of her voice became sweeter\\nto his ears.  So sweet was her voice that he forgot his nets and his\\ncunning, and had no care of his craft.  Vermilion-finned and with eyes of\\nbossy gold, the tunnies went by in shoals, but he heeded them not.  His\\nspear lay by his side unused, and his baskets of plaited osier were\\nempty.  With lips parted, and eyes dim with wonder, he sat idle in his\\nboat and listened, listening till the sea-mists crept round him, and the\\nwandering moon stained his brown limbs with silver.\\n\\nAnd one evening he called to her, and said: ‚ÄòLittle Mermaid, little\\nMermaid, I love thee.  Take me for thy bridegroom, for I love thee.‚Äô\\n\\nBut the Mermaid shook her head.  ‚ÄòThou hast a human soul,‚Äô she answered.\\n‚ÄòIf only thou wouldst send away thy soul, then could I love thee.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman said to himself, ‚ÄòOf what use is my soul to me?\\nI cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do not know it.  Surely I will\\nsend it away from me, and much gladness shall be mine.‚Äô  And a cry of joy\\nbroke from his lips, and standing up in the painted boat, he held out his\\narms to the Mermaid.  ‚ÄòI will send my soul away,‚Äô he cried, ‚Äòand you\\nshall be my bride, and I will be thy bridegroom, and in the depth of the\\nsea we will dwell together, and all that thou hast sung of thou shalt\\nshow me, and all that thou desirest I will do, nor shall our lives be\\ndivided.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the little Mermaid laughed for pleasure and hid her face in her\\nhands.\\n\\n‚ÄòBut how shall I send my soul from me?‚Äô cried the young Fisherman.  ‚ÄòTell\\nme how I may do it, and lo! it shall be done.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòAlas!  I know not,‚Äô said the little Mermaid: ‚Äòthe Sea-folk have no\\nsouls.‚Äô  And she sank down into the deep, looking wistfully at him.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nNow early on the next morning, before the sun was the span of a man‚Äôs\\nhand above the hill, the young Fisherman went to the house of the Priest\\nand knocked three times at the door.\\n\\nThe novice looked out through the wicket, and when he saw who it was, he\\ndrew back the latch and said to him, ‚ÄòEnter.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman passed in, and knelt down on the sweet-smelling\\nrushes of the floor, and cried to the Priest who was reading out of the\\nHoly Book and said to him, ‚ÄòFather, I am in love with one of the\\nSea-folk, and my soul hindereth me from having my desire.  Tell me how I\\ncan send my soul away from me, for in truth I have no need of it.  Of\\nwhat value is my soul to me?  I cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do\\nnot know it.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Priest beat his breast, and answered, ‚ÄòAlack, alack, thou art\\nmad, or hast eaten of some poisonous herb, for the soul is the noblest\\npart of man, and was given to us by God that we should nobly use it.\\nThere is no thing more precious than a human soul, nor any earthly thing\\nthat can be weighed with it.  It is worth all the gold that is in the\\nworld, and is more precious than the rubies of the kings.  Therefore, my\\nson, think not any more of this matter, for it is a sin that may not be\\nforgiven.  And as for the Sea-folk, they are lost, and they who would\\ntraffic with them are lost also.  They are as the beasts of the field\\nthat know not good from evil, and for them the Lord has not died.‚Äô\\n\\nThe young Fisherman‚Äôs eyes filled with tears when he heard the bitter\\nwords of the Priest, and he rose up from his knees and said to him,\\n‚ÄòFather, the Fauns live in the forest and are glad, and on the rocks sit\\nthe Mermen with their harps of red gold.  Let me be as they are, I\\nbeseech thee, for their days are as the days of flowers.  And as for my\\nsoul, what doth my soul profit me, if it stand between me and the thing\\nthat I love?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòThe love of the body is vile,‚Äô cried the Priest, knitting his brows,\\n‚Äòand vile and evil are the pagan things God suffers to wander through His\\nworld.  Accursed be the Fauns of the woodland, and accursed be the\\nsingers of the sea!  I have heard them at night-time, and they have\\nsought to lure me from my beads.  They tap at the window, and laugh.\\nThey whisper into my ears the tale of their perilous joys.  They tempt me\\nwith temptations, and when I would pray they make mouths at me.  They are\\nlost, I tell thee, they are lost.  For them there is no heaven nor hell,\\nand in neither shall they praise God‚Äôs name.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòFather,‚Äô cried the young Fisherman, ‚Äòthou knowest not what thou sayest.\\nOnce in my net I snared the daughter of a King.  She is fairer than the\\nmorning star, and whiter than the moon.  For her body I would give my\\nsoul, and for her love I would surrender heaven.  Tell me what I ask of\\nthee, and let me go in peace.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòAway!  Away!‚Äô cried the Priest: ‚Äòthy leman is lost, and thou shalt be\\nlost with her.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd he gave him no blessing, but drove him from his door.\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman went down into the market-place, and he walked\\nslowly, and with bowed head, as one who is in sorrow.\\n\\nAnd when the merchants saw him coming, they began to whisper to each\\nother, and one of them came forth to meet him, and called him by name,\\nand said to him, ‚ÄòWhat hast thou to sell?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòI will sell thee my soul,‚Äô he answered.  ‚ÄòI pray thee buy it of me, for\\nI am weary of it.  Of what use is my soul to me?  I cannot see it.  I may\\nnot touch it.  I do not know it.‚Äô\\n\\nBut the merchants mocked at him, and said, ‚ÄòOf what use is a man‚Äôs soul\\nto us?  It is not worth a clipped piece of silver.  Sell us thy body for\\na slave, and we will clothe thee in sea-purple, and put a ring upon thy\\nfinger, and make thee the minion of the great Queen.  But talk not of the\\nsoul, for to us it is nought, nor has it any value for our service.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman said to himself: ‚ÄòHow strange a thing this is!\\nThe Priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world,\\nand the merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver.‚Äô\\nAnd he passed out of the market-place, and went down to the shore of the\\nsea, and began to ponder on what he should do.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd at noon he remembered how one of his companions, who was a gatherer\\nof samphire, had told him of a certain young Witch who dwelt in a cave at\\nthe head of the bay and was very cunning in her witcheries.  And he set\\nto and ran, so eager was he to get rid of his soul, and a cloud of dust\\nfollowed him as he sped round the sand of the shore.  By the itching of\\nher palm the young Witch knew his coming, and she laughed and let down\\nher red hair.  With her red hair falling around her, she stood at the\\nopening of the cave, and in her hand she had a spray of wild hemlock that\\nwas blossoming.\\n\\n‚ÄòWhat d‚Äôye lack?  What d‚Äôye lack?‚Äô she cried, as he came panting up the\\nsteep, and bent down before her.  ‚ÄòFish for thy net, when the wind is\\nfoul?  I have a little reed-pipe, and when I blow on it the mullet come\\nsailing into the bay.  But it has a price, pretty boy, it has a price.\\nWhat d‚Äôye lack?  What d‚Äôye lack?  A storm to wreck the ships, and wash\\nthe chests of rich treasure ashore?  I have more storms than the wind\\nhas, for I serve one who is stronger than the wind, and with a sieve and\\na pail of water I can send the great galleys to the bottom of the sea.\\nBut I have a price, pretty boy, I have a price.  What d‚Äôye lack?  What\\nd‚Äôye lack?  I know a flower that grows in the valley, none knows it but\\nI.  It has purple leaves, and a star in its heart, and its juice is as\\nwhite as milk.  Shouldst thou touch with this flower the hard lips of the\\nQueen, she would follow thee all over the world.  Out of the bed of the\\nKing she would rise, and over the whole world she would follow thee.  And\\nit has a price, pretty boy, it has a price.  What d‚Äôye lack?  What d‚Äôye\\nlack?  I can pound a toad in a mortar, and make broth of it, and stir the\\nbroth with a dead man‚Äôs hand.  Sprinkle it on thine enemy while he\\nsleeps, and he will turn into a black viper, and his own mother will slay\\nhim.  With a wheel I can draw the Moon from heaven, and in a crystal I\\ncan show thee Death.  What d‚Äôye lack?  What d‚Äôye lack?  Tell me thy\\ndesire, and I will give it thee, and thou shalt pay me a price, pretty\\nboy, thou shalt pay me a price.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòMy desire is but for a little thing,‚Äô said the young Fisherman, ‚Äòyet\\nhath the Priest been wroth with me, and driven me forth.  It is but for a\\nlittle thing, and the merchants have mocked at me, and denied me.\\nTherefore am I come to thee, though men call thee evil, and whatever be\\nthy price I shall pay it.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòWhat wouldst thou?‚Äô asked the Witch, coming near to him.\\n\\n‚ÄòI would send my soul away from me,‚Äô answered the young Fisherman.\\n\\nThe Witch grew pale, and shuddered, and hid her face in her blue mantle.\\n‚ÄòPretty boy, pretty boy,‚Äô she muttered, ‚Äòthat is a terrible thing to do.‚Äô\\n\\nHe tossed his brown curls and laughed.  ‚ÄòMy soul is nought to me,‚Äô he\\nanswered.  ‚ÄòI cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do not know it.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòWhat wilt thou give me if I tell thee?‚Äô asked the Witch, looking down at\\nhim with her beautiful eyes.\\n\\n‚ÄòFive pieces of gold,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòand my nets, and the wattled house where\\nI live, and the painted boat in which I sail.  Only tell me how to get\\nrid of my soul, and I will give thee all that I possess.‚Äô\\n\\nShe laughed mockingly at him, and struck him with the spray of hemlock.\\n‚ÄòI can turn the autumn leaves into gold,‚Äô she answered, ‚Äòand I can weave\\nthe pale moonbeams into silver if I will it.  He whom I serve is richer\\nthan all the kings of this world, and has their dominions.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòWhat then shall I give thee,‚Äô he cried, ‚Äòif thy price be neither gold\\nnor silver?‚Äô\\n\\nThe Witch stroked his hair with her thin white hand.  ‚ÄòThou must dance\\nwith me, pretty boy,‚Äô she murmured, and she smiled at him as she spoke.\\n\\n‚ÄòNought but that?‚Äô cried the young Fisherman in wonder and he rose to his\\nfeet.\\n\\n‚ÄòNought but that,‚Äô she answered, and she smiled at him again.\\n\\n‚ÄòThen at sunset in some secret place we shall dance together,‚Äô he said,\\n‚Äòand after that we have danced thou shalt tell me the thing which I\\ndesire to know.‚Äô\\n\\nShe shook her head.  ‚ÄòWhen the moon is full, when the moon is full,‚Äô she\\nmuttered.  Then she peered all round, and listened.  A blue bird rose\\nscreaming from its nest and circled over the dunes, and three spotted\\nbirds rustled through the coarse grey grass and whistled to each other.\\nThere was no other sound save the sound of a wave fretting the smooth\\npebbles below.  So she reached out her hand, and drew him near to her and\\nput her dry lips close to his ear.\\n\\n‚ÄòTo-night thou must come to the top of the mountain,‚Äô she whispered.  ‚ÄòIt\\nis a Sabbath, and He will be there.‚Äô\\n\\nThe young Fisherman started and looked at her, and she showed her white\\nteeth and laughed.  ‚ÄòWho is He of whom thou speakest?‚Äô he asked.\\n\\n‚ÄòIt matters not,‚Äô she answered.  ‚ÄòGo thou to-night, and stand under the\\nbranches of the hornbeam, and wait for my coming.  If a black dog run\\ntowards thee, strike it with a rod of willow, and it will go away.  If an\\nowl speak to thee, make it no answer.  When the moon is full I shall be\\nwith thee, and we will dance together on the grass.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòBut wilt thou swear to me to tell me how I may send my soul from me?‚Äô he\\nmade question.\\n\\nShe moved out into the sunlight, and through her red hair rippled the\\nwind.  ‚ÄòBy the hoofs of the goat I swear it,‚Äô she made answer.\\n\\n‚ÄòThou art the best of the witches,‚Äô cried the young Fisherman, ‚Äòand I\\nwill surely dance with thee to-night on the top of the mountain.  I would\\nindeed that thou hadst asked of me either gold or silver.  But such as\\nthy price is thou shalt have it, for it is but a little thing.‚Äô  And he\\ndoffed his cap to her, and bent his head low, and ran back to the town\\nfilled with a great joy.\\n\\nAnd the Witch watched him as he went, and when he had passed from her\\nsight she entered her cave, and having taken a mirror from a box of\\ncarved cedarwood, she set it up on a frame, and burned vervain on lighted\\ncharcoal before it, and peered through the coils of the smoke.  And after\\na time she clenched her hands in anger.  ‚ÄòHe should have been mine,‚Äô she\\nmuttered, ‚ÄòI am as fair as she is.‚Äô\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd that evening, when the moon had risen, the young Fisherman climbed up\\nto the top of the mountain, and stood under the branches of the hornbeam.\\nLike a targe of polished metal the round sea lay at his feet, and the\\nshadows of the fishing-boats moved in the little bay.  A great owl, with\\nyellow sulphurous eyes, called to him by his name, but he made it no\\nanswer.  A black dog ran towards him and snarled.  He struck it with a\\nrod of willow, and it went away whining.\\n\\nAt midnight the witches came flying through the air like bats.  ‚ÄòPhew!‚Äô\\nthey cried, as they lit upon the ground, ‚Äòthere is some one here we know\\nnot!‚Äô and they sniffed about, and chattered to each other, and made\\nsigns.  Last of all came the young Witch, with her red hair streaming in\\nthe wind.  She wore a dress of gold tissue embroidered with peacocks‚Äô\\neyes, and a little cap of green velvet was on her head.\\n\\n‚ÄòWhere is he, where is he?‚Äô shrieked the witches when they saw her, but\\nshe only laughed, and ran to the hornbeam, and taking the Fisherman by\\nthe hand she led him out into the moonlight and began to dance.\\n\\nRound and round they whirled, and the young Witch jumped so high that he\\ncould see the scarlet heels of her shoes.  Then right across the dancers\\ncame the sound of the galloping of a horse, but no horse was to be seen,\\nand he felt afraid.\\n\\n‚ÄòFaster,‚Äô cried the Witch, and she threw her arms about his neck, and her\\nbreath was hot upon his face.  ‚ÄòFaster, faster!‚Äô she cried, and the earth\\nseemed to spin beneath his feet, and his brain grew troubled, and a great\\nterror fell on him, as of some evil thing that was watching him, and at\\nlast he became aware that under the shadow of a rock there was a figure\\nthat had not been there before.\\n\\nIt was a man dressed in a suit of black velvet, cut in the Spanish\\nfashion.  His face was strangely pale, but his lips were like a proud red\\nflower.  He seemed weary, and was leaning back toying in a listless\\nmanner with the pommel of his dagger.  On the grass beside him lay a\\nplumed hat, and a pair of riding-gloves gauntleted with gilt lace, and\\nsewn with seed-pearls wrought into a curious device.  A short cloak lined\\nwith sables hang from his shoulder, and his delicate white hands were\\ngemmed with rings.  Heavy eyelids drooped over his eyes.\\n\\nThe young Fisherman watched him, as one snared in a spell.  At last their\\neyes met, and wherever he danced it seemed to him that the eyes of the\\nman were upon him.  He heard the Witch laugh, and caught her by the\\nwaist, and whirled her madly round and round.\\n\\nSuddenly a dog bayed in the wood, and the dancers stopped, and going up\\ntwo by two, knelt down, and kissed the man‚Äôs hands.  As they did so, a\\nlittle smile touched his proud lips, as a bird‚Äôs wing touches the water\\nand makes it laugh.  But there was disdain in it.  He kept looking at the\\nyoung Fisherman.\\n\\n‚ÄòCome! let us worship,‚Äô whispered the Witch, and she led him up, and a\\ngreat desire to do as she besought him seized on him, and he followed\\nher.  But when he came close, and without knowing why he did it, he made\\non his breast the sign of the Cross, and called upon the holy name.\\n\\nNo sooner had he done so than the witches screamed like hawks and flew\\naway, and the pallid face that had been watching him twitched with a\\nspasm of pain.  The man went over to a little wood, and whistled.  A\\njennet with silver trappings came running to meet him.  As he leapt upon\\nthe saddle he turned round, and looked at the young Fisherman sadly.\\n\\nAnd the Witch with the red hair tried to fly away also, but the Fisherman\\ncaught her by her wrists, and held her fast.\\n\\n‚ÄòLoose me,‚Äô she cried, ‚Äòand let me go.  For thou hast named what should\\nnot be named, and shown the sign that may not be looked at.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay,‚Äô he answered, ‚Äòbut I will not let thee go till thou hast told me\\nthe secret.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòWhat secret?‚Äô said the Witch, wrestling with him like a wild cat, and\\nbiting her foam-flecked lips.\\n\\n‚ÄòThou knowest,‚Äô he made answer.\\n\\nHer grass-green eyes grew dim with tears, and she said to the Fisherman,\\n‚ÄòAsk me anything but that!‚Äô\\n\\nHe laughed, and held her all the more tightly.\\n\\nAnd when she saw that she could not free herself, she whispered to him,\\n‚ÄòSurely I am as fair as the daughters of the sea, and as comely as those\\nthat dwell in the blue waters,‚Äô and she fawned on him and put her face\\nclose to his.\\n\\nBut he thrust her back frowning, and said to her, ‚ÄòIf thou keepest not\\nthe promise that thou madest to me I will slay thee for a false witch.‚Äô\\n\\nShe grew grey as a blossom of the Judas tree, and shuddered.  ‚ÄòBe it so,‚Äô\\nshe muttered.  ‚ÄòIt is thy soul and not mine.  Do with it as thou wilt.‚Äô\\nAnd she took from her girdle a little knife that had a handle of green\\nviper‚Äôs skin, and gave it to him.\\n\\n‚ÄòWhat shall this serve me?‚Äô he asked of her, wondering.\\n\\nShe was silent for a few moments, and a look of terror came over her\\nface.  Then she brushed her hair back from her forehead, and smiling\\nstrangely she said to him, ‚ÄòWhat men call the shadow of the body is not\\nthe shadow of the body, but is the body of the soul.  Stand on the\\nsea-shore with thy back to the moon, and cut away from around thy feet\\nthy shadow, which is thy soul‚Äôs body, and bid thy soul leave thee, and it\\nwill do so.‚Äô\\n\\nThe young Fisherman trembled.  ‚ÄòIs this true?‚Äô he murmured.\\n\\n‚ÄòIt is true, and I would that I had not told thee of it,‚Äô she cried, and\\nshe clung to his knees weeping.\\n\\nHe put her from him and left her in the rank grass, and going to the edge\\nof the mountain he placed the knife in his belt and began to climb down.\\n\\nAnd his Soul that was within him called out to him and said, ‚ÄòLo!  I have\\ndwelt with thee for all these years, and have been thy servant.  Send me\\nnot away from thee now, for what evil have I done thee?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman laughed.  ‚ÄòThou hast done me no evil, but I have\\nno need of thee,‚Äô he answered.  ‚ÄòThe world is wide, and there is Heaven\\nalso, and Hell, and that dim twilight house that lies between.  Go\\nwherever thou wilt, but trouble me not, for my love is calling to me.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd his Soul besought him piteously, but he heeded it not, but leapt from\\ncrag to crag, being sure-footed as a wild goat, and at last he reached\\nthe level ground and the yellow shore of the sea.\\n\\nBronze-limbed and well-knit, like a statue wrought by a Grecian, he stood\\non the sand with his back to the moon, and out of the foam came white\\narms that beckoned to him, and out of the waves rose dim forms that did\\nhim homage.  Before him lay his shadow, which was the body of his soul,\\nand behind him hung the moon in the honey-coloured air.\\n\\nAnd his Soul said to him, ‚ÄòIf indeed thou must drive me from thee, send\\nme not forth without a heart.  The world is cruel, give me thy heart to\\ntake with me.‚Äô\\n\\nHe tossed his head and smiled.  ‚ÄòWith what should I love my love if I\\ngave thee my heart?‚Äô he cried.\\n\\n‚ÄòNay, but be merciful,‚Äô said his Soul: ‚Äògive me thy heart, for the world\\nis very cruel, and I am afraid.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòMy heart is my love‚Äôs,‚Äô he answered, ‚Äòtherefore tarry not, but get thee\\ngone.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòShould I not love also?‚Äô asked his Soul.\\n\\n‚ÄòGet thee gone, for I have no need of thee,‚Äô cried the young Fisherman,\\nand he took the little knife with its handle of green viper‚Äôs skin, and\\ncut away his shadow from around his feet, and it rose up and stood before\\nhim, and looked at him, and it was even as himself.\\n\\nHe crept back, and thrust the knife into his belt, and a feeling of awe\\ncame over him.  ‚ÄòGet thee gone,‚Äô he murmured, ‚Äòand let me see thy face no\\nmore.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay, but we must meet again,‚Äô said the Soul.  Its voice was low and\\nflute-like, and its lips hardly moved while it spake.\\n\\n‚ÄòHow shall we meet?‚Äô cried the young Fisherman.  ‚ÄòThou wilt not follow me\\ninto the depths of the sea?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòOnce every year I will come to this place, and call to thee,‚Äô said the\\nSoul.  ‚ÄòIt may be that thou wilt have need of me.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòWhat need should I have of thee?‚Äô cried the young Fisherman, ‚Äòbut be it\\nas thou wilt,‚Äô and he plunged into the waters and the Tritons blew their\\nhorns and the little Mermaid rose up to meet him, and put her arms around\\nhis neck and kissed him on the mouth.\\n\\nAnd the Soul stood on the lonely beach and watched them.  And when they\\nhad sunk down into the sea, it went weeping away over the marshes.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd after a year was over the Soul came down to the shore of the sea and\\ncalled to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep, and said,\\n‚ÄòWhy dost thou call to me?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Soul answered, ‚ÄòCome nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I\\nhave seen marvellous things.‚Äô\\n\\nSo he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head\\nupon his hand and listened.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd the Soul said to him, ‚ÄòWhen I left thee I turned my face to the East\\nand journeyed.  From the East cometh everything that is wise.  Six days I\\njourneyed, and on the morning of the seventh day I came to a hill that is\\nin the country of the Tartars.  I sat down under the shade of a tamarisk\\ntree to shelter myself from the sun.  The land was dry and burnt up with\\nthe heat.  The people went to and fro over the plain like flies crawling\\nupon a disk of polished copper.\\n\\n‚ÄòWhen it was noon a cloud of red dust rose up from the flat rim of the\\nland.  When the Tartars saw it, they strung their painted bows, and\\nhaving leapt upon their little horses they galloped to meet it.  The\\nwomen fled screaming to the waggons, and hid themselves behind the felt\\ncurtains.\\n\\n‚ÄòAt twilight the Tartars returned, but five of them were missing, and of\\nthose that came back not a few had been wounded.  They harnessed their\\nhorses to the waggons and drove hastily away.  Three jackals came out of\\na cave and peered after them.  Then they sniffed up the air with their\\nnostrils, and trotted off in the opposite direction.\\n\\n‚ÄòWhen the moon rose I saw a camp-fire burning on the plain, and went\\ntowards it.  A company of merchants were seated round it on carpets.\\nTheir camels were picketed behind them, and the negroes who were their\\nservants were pitching tents of tanned skin upon the sand, and making a\\nhigh wall of the prickly pear.\\n\\n‚ÄòAs I came near them, the chief of the merchants rose up and drew his\\nsword, and asked me my business.\\n\\n‚ÄòI answered that I was a Prince in my own land, and that I had escaped\\nfrom the Tartars, who had sought to make me their slave.  The chief\\nsmiled, and showed me five heads fixed upon long reeds of bamboo.\\n\\n‚ÄòThen he asked me who was the prophet of God, and I answered him\\nMohammed.\\n\\n‚ÄòWhen he heard the name of the false prophet, he bowed and took me by the\\nhand, and placed me by his side.  A negro brought me some mare‚Äôs milk in\\na wooden dish, and a piece of lamb‚Äôs flesh roasted.\\n\\n‚ÄòAt daybreak we started on our journey.  I rode on a red-haired camel by\\nthe side of the chief, and a runner ran before us carrying a spear.  The\\nmen of war were on either hand, and the mules followed with the\\nmerchandise.  There were forty camels in the caravan, and the mules were\\ntwice forty in number.\\n\\n‚ÄòWe went from the country of the Tartars into the country of those who\\ncurse the Moon.  We saw the Gryphons guarding their gold on the white\\nrocks, and the scaled Dragons sleeping in their caves.  As we passed over\\nthe mountains we held our breath lest the snows might fall on us, and\\neach man tied a veil of gauze before his eyes.  As we passed through the\\nvalleys the Pygmies shot arrows at us from the hollows of the trees, and\\nat night-time we heard the wild men beating on their drums.  When we came\\nto the Tower of Apes we set fruits before them, and they did not harm us.\\nWhen we came to the Tower of Serpents we gave them warm milk in howls of\\nbrass, and they let us go by.  Three times in our journey we came to the\\nbanks of the Oxus.  We crossed it on rafts of wood with great bladders of\\nblown hide.  The river-horses raged against us and sought to slay us.\\nWhen the camels saw them they trembled.\\n\\n‚ÄòThe kings of each city levied tolls on us, but would not suffer us to\\nenter their gates.  They threw us bread over the walls, little\\nmaize-cakes baked in honey and cakes of fine flour filled with dates.\\nFor every hundred baskets we gave them a bead of amber.\\n\\n‚ÄòWhen the dwellers in the villages saw us coming, they poisoned the wells\\nand fled to the hill-summits.  We fought with the Magadae who are born\\nold, and grow younger and younger every year, and die when they are\\nlittle children; and with the Laktroi who say that they are the sons of\\ntigers, and paint themselves yellow and black; and with the Aurantes who\\nbury their dead on the tops of trees, and themselves live in dark caverns\\nlest the Sun, who is their god, should slay them; and with the Krimnians\\nwho worship a crocodile, and give it earrings of green glass, and feed it\\nwith butter and fresh fowls; and with the Agazonbae, who are dog-faced;\\nand with the Sibans, who have horses‚Äô feet, and run more swiftly than\\nhorses.  A third of our company died in battle, and a third died of want.\\nThe rest murmured against me, and said that I had brought them an evil\\nfortune.  I took a horned adder from beneath a stone and let it sting me.\\nWhen they saw that I did not sicken they grew afraid.\\n\\n‚ÄòIn the fourth month we reached the city of Illel.  It was night-time\\nwhen we came to the grove that is outside the walls, and the air was\\nsultry, for the Moon was travelling in Scorpion.  We took the ripe\\npomegranates from the trees, and brake them, and drank their sweet\\njuices.  Then we lay down on our carpets, and waited for the dawn.\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd at dawn we rose and knocked at the gate of the city.  It was wrought\\nout of red bronze, and carved with sea-dragons and dragons that have\\nwings.  The guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our\\nbusiness.  The interpreter of the caravan answered that we had come from\\nthe island of Syria with much merchandise.  They took hostages, and told\\nus that they would open the gate to us at noon, and bade us tarry till\\nthen.\\n\\n‚ÄòWhen it was noon they opened the gate, and as we entered in the people\\ncame crowding out of the houses to look at us, and a crier went round the\\ncity crying through a shell.  We stood in the market-place, and the\\nnegroes uncorded the bales of figured cloths and opened the carved chests\\nof sycamore.  And when they had ended their task, the merchants set forth\\ntheir strange wares, the waxed linen from Egypt and the painted linen\\nfrom the country of the Ethiops, the purple sponges from Tyre and the\\nblue hangings from Sidon, the cups of cold amber and the fine vessels of\\nglass and the curious vessels of burnt clay.  From the roof of a house a\\ncompany of women watched us.  One of them wore a mask of gilded leather.\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd on the first day the priests came and bartered with us, and on the\\nsecond day came the nobles, and on the third day came the craftsmen and\\nthe slaves.  And this is their custom with all merchants as long as they\\ntarry in the city.\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd we tarried for a moon, and when the moon was waning, I wearied and\\nwandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of\\nits god.  The priests in their yellow robes moved silently through the\\ngreen trees, and on a pavement of black marble stood the rose-red house\\nin which the god had his dwelling.  Its doors were of powdered lacquer,\\nand bulls and peacocks were wrought on them in raised and polished gold.\\nThe tilted roof was of sea-green porcelain, and the jutting eaves were\\nfestooned with little bells.  When the white doves flew past, they struck\\nthe bells with their wings and made them tinkle.\\n\\n‚ÄòIn front of the temple was a pool of clear water paved with veined onyx.\\nI lay down beside it, and with my pale fingers I touched the broad\\nleaves.  One of the priests came towards me and stood behind me.  He had\\nsandals on his feet, one of soft serpent-skin and the other of birds‚Äô\\nplumage.  On his head was a mitre of black felt decorated with silver\\ncrescents.  Seven yellows were woven into his robe, and his frizzed hair\\nwas stained with antimony.\\n\\n‚ÄòAfter a little while he spake to me, and asked me my desire.\\n\\n‚ÄòI told him that my desire was to see the god.\\n\\n‚Äò‚ÄúThe god is hunting,‚Äù said the priest, looking strangely at me with his\\nsmall slanting eyes.\\n\\n‚Äò‚ÄúTell me in what forest, and I will ride with him,‚Äù I answered.\\n\\n‚ÄòHe combed out the soft fringes of his tunic with his long pointed nails.\\n‚ÄúThe god is asleep,‚Äù he murmured.\\n\\n‚Äò‚ÄúTell me on what couch, and I will watch by him,‚Äù I answered.\\n\\n‚Äò‚ÄúThe god is at the feast,‚Äù he cried.\\n\\n‚Äò‚ÄúIf the wine be sweet I will drink it with him, and if it be bitter I\\nwill drink it with him also,‚Äù was my answer.\\n\\n‚ÄòHe bowed his head in wonder, and, taking me by the hand, he raised me\\nup, and led me into the temple.\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd in the first chamber I saw an idol seated on a throne of jasper\\nbordered with great orient pearls.  It was carved out of ebony, and in\\nstature was of the stature of a man.  On its forehead was a ruby, and\\nthick oil dripped from its hair on to its thighs.  Its feet were red with\\nthe blood of a newly-slain kid, and its loins girt with a copper belt\\nthat was studded with seven beryls.\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd I said to the priest, ‚ÄúIs this the god?‚Äù  And he answered me, ‚ÄúThis\\nis the god.‚Äù\\n\\n‚Äò‚ÄúShow me the god,‚Äù I cried, ‚Äúor I will surely slay thee.‚Äù  And I touched\\nhis hand, and it became withered.\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd the priest besought me, saying, ‚ÄúLet my lord heal his servant, and I\\nwill show him the god.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄòSo I breathed with my breath upon his hand, and it became whole again,\\nand he trembled and led me into the second chamber, and I saw an idol\\nstanding on a lotus of jade hung with great emeralds.  It was carved out\\nof ivory, and in stature was twice the stature of a man.  On its forehead\\nwas a chrysolite, and its breasts were smeared with myrrh and cinnamon.\\nIn one hand it held a crooked sceptre of jade, and in the other a round\\ncrystal.  It ware buskins of brass, and its thick neck was circled with a\\ncircle of selenites.\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd I said to the priest, ‚ÄúIs this the god?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd he answered me, ‚ÄúThis is the god.‚Äù\\n\\n‚Äò‚ÄúShow me the god,‚Äù I cried, ‚Äúor I will surely slay thee.‚Äù  And I touched\\nhis eyes, and they became blind.\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd the priest besought me, saying, ‚ÄúLet my lord heal his servant, and I\\nwill show him the god.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄòSo I breathed with my breath upon his eyes, and the sight came back to\\nthem, and he trembled again, and led me into the third chamber, and lo!\\nthere was no idol in it, nor image of any kind, but only a mirror of\\nround metal set on an altar of stone.\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd I said to the priest, ‚ÄúWhere is the god?‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd he answered me: ‚ÄúThere is no god but this mirror that thou seest,\\nfor this is the Mirror of Wisdom.  And it reflecteth all things that are\\nin heaven and on earth, save only the face of him who looketh into it.\\nThis it reflecteth not, so that he who looketh into it may be wise.  Many\\nother mirrors are there, but they are mirrors of Opinion.  This only is\\nthe Mirror of Wisdom.  And they who possess this mirror know everything,\\nnor is there anything hidden from them.  And they who possess it not have\\nnot Wisdom.  Therefore is it the god, and we worship it.‚Äù  And I looked\\ninto the mirror, and it was even as he had said to me.\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a valley\\nthat is but a day‚Äôs journey from this place have I hidden the Mirror of\\nWisdom.  Do but suffer me to enter into thee again and be thy servant,\\nand thou shalt be wiser than all the wise men, and Wisdom shall be thine.\\nSuffer me to enter into thee, and none will be as wise as thou.‚Äô\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman laughed.  ‚ÄòLove is better than Wisdom,‚Äô he cried,\\n‚Äòand the little Mermaid loves me.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay, but there is nothing better than Wisdom,‚Äô said the Soul.\\n\\n‚ÄòLove is better,‚Äô answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the\\ndeep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd after the second year was over, the Soul came down to the shore of\\nthe sea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep\\nand said, ‚ÄòWhy dost thou call to me?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Soul answered, ‚ÄòCome nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I\\nhave seen marvellous things.‚Äô\\n\\nSo he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head\\nupon his hand and listened.\\n\\nAnd the Soul said to him, ‚ÄòWhen I left thee, I turned my face to the\\nSouth and journeyed.  From the South cometh everything that is precious.\\nSix days I journeyed along the highways that lead to the city of Ashter,\\nalong the dusty red-dyed highways by which the pilgrims are wont to go\\ndid I journey, and on the morning of the seventh day I lifted up my eyes,\\nand lo! the city lay at my feet, for it is in a valley.\\n\\n‚ÄòThere are nine gates to this city, and in front of each gate stands a\\nbronze horse that neighs when the Bedouins come down from the mountains.\\nThe walls are cased with copper, and the watch-towers on the walls are\\nroofed with brass.  In every tower stands an archer with a bow in his\\nhand.  At sunrise he strikes with an arrow on a gong, and at sunset he\\nblows through a horn of horn.\\n\\n‚ÄòWhen I sought to enter, the guards stopped me and asked of me who I was.\\nI made answer that I was a Dervish and on my way to the city of Mecca,\\nwhere there was a green veil on which the Koran was embroidered in silver\\nletters by the hands of the angels.  They were filled with wonder, and\\nentreated me to pass in.\\n\\n‚ÄòInside it is even as a bazaar.  Surely thou shouldst have been with me.\\nAcross the narrow streets the gay lanterns of paper flutter like large\\nbutterflies.  When the wind blows over the roofs they rise and fall as\\npainted bubbles do.  In front of their booths sit the merchants on silken\\ncarpets.  They have straight black beards, and their turbans are covered\\nwith golden sequins, and long strings of amber and carved peach-stones\\nglide through their cool fingers.  Some of them sell galbanum and nard,\\nand curious perfumes from the islands of the Indian Sea, and the thick\\noil of red roses, and myrrh and little nail-shaped cloves.  When one\\nstops to speak to them, they throw pinches of frankincense upon a\\ncharcoal brazier and make the air sweet.  I saw a Syrian who held in his\\nhands a thin rod like a reed.  Grey threads of smoke came from it, and\\nits odour as it burned was as the odour of the pink almond in spring.\\nOthers sell silver bracelets embossed all over with creamy blue turquoise\\nstones, and anklets of brass wire fringed with little pearls, and tigers‚Äô\\nclaws set in gold, and the claws of that gilt cat, the leopard, set in\\ngold also, and earrings of pierced emerald, and finger-rings of hollowed\\njade.  From the tea-houses comes the sound of the guitar, and the\\nopium-smokers with their white smiling faces look out at the passers-by.\\n\\n‚ÄòOf a truth thou shouldst have been with me.  The wine-sellers elbow\\ntheir way through the crowd with great black skins on their shoulders.\\nMost of them sell the wine of Schiraz, which is as sweet as honey.  They\\nserve it in little metal cups and strew rose leaves upon it.  In the\\nmarket-place stand the fruitsellers, who sell all kinds of fruit: ripe\\nfigs, with their bruised purple flesh, melons, smelling of musk and\\nyellow as topazes, citrons and rose-apples and clusters of white grapes,\\nround red-gold oranges, and oval lemons of green gold.  Once I saw an\\nelephant go by.  Its trunk was painted with vermilion and turmeric, and\\nover its ears it had a net of crimson silk cord.  It stopped opposite one\\nof the booths and began eating the oranges, and the man only laughed.\\nThou canst not think how strange a people they are.  When they are glad\\nthey go to the bird-sellers and buy of them a caged bird, and set it free\\nthat their joy may be greater, and when they are sad they scourge\\nthemselves with thorns that their sorrow may not grow less.\\n\\n‚ÄòOne evening I met some negroes carrying a heavy palanquin through the\\nbazaar.  It was made of gilded bamboo, and the poles were of vermilion\\nlacquer studded with brass peacocks.  Across the windows hung thin\\ncurtains of muslin embroidered with beetles‚Äô wings and with tiny\\nseed-pearls, and as it passed by a pale-faced Circassian looked out and\\nsmiled at me.  I followed behind, and the negroes hurried their steps and\\nscowled.  But I did not care.  I felt a great curiosity come over me.\\n\\n‚ÄòAt last they stopped at a square white house.  There were no windows to\\nit, only a little door like the door of a tomb.  They set down the\\npalanquin and knocked three times with a copper hammer.  An Armenian in a\\ncaftan of green leather peered through the wicket, and when he saw them\\nhe opened, and spread a carpet on the ground, and the woman stepped out.\\nAs she went in, she turned round and smiled at me again.  I had never\\nseen any one so pale.\\n\\n‚ÄòWhen the moon rose I returned to the same place and sought for the\\nhouse, but it was no longer there.  When I saw that, I knew who the woman\\nwas, and wherefore she had smiled at me.\\n\\n‚ÄòCertainly thou shouldst have been with me.  On the feast of the New Moon\\nthe young Emperor came forth from his palace and went into the mosque to\\npray.  His hair and beard were dyed with rose-leaves, and his cheeks were\\npowdered with a fine gold dust.  The palms of his feet and hands were\\nyellow with saffron.\\n\\n‚ÄòAt sunrise he went forth from his palace in a robe of silver, and at\\nsunset he returned to it again in a robe of gold.  The people flung\\nthemselves on the ground and hid their faces, but I would not do so.  I\\nstood by the stall of a seller of dates and waited.  When the Emperor saw\\nme, he raised his painted eyebrows and stopped.  I stood quite still, and\\nmade him no obeisance.  The people marvelled at my boldness, and\\ncounselled me to flee from the city.  I paid no heed to them, but went\\nand sat with the sellers of strange gods, who by reason of their craft\\nare abominated.  When I told them what I had done, each of them gave me a\\ngod and prayed me to leave them.\\n\\n‚ÄòThat night, as I lay on a cushion in the tea-house that is in the Street\\nof Pomegranates, the guards of the Emperor entered and led me to the\\npalace.  As I went in they closed each door behind me, and put a chain\\nacross it.  Inside was a great court with an arcade running all round.\\nThe walls were of white alabaster, set here and there with blue and green\\ntiles.  The pillars were of green marble, and the pavement of a kind of\\npeach-blossom marble.  I had never seen anything like it before.\\n\\n‚ÄòAs I passed across the court two veiled women looked down from a balcony\\nand cursed me.  The guards hastened on, and the butts of the lances rang\\nupon the polished floor.  They opened a gate of wrought ivory, and I\\nfound myself in a watered garden of seven terraces.  It was planted with\\ntulip-cups and moonflowers, and silver-studded aloes.  Like a slim reed\\nof crystal a fountain hung in the dusky air.  The cypress-trees were like\\nburnt-out torches.  From one of them a nightingale was singing.\\n\\n‚ÄòAt the end of the garden stood a little pavilion.  As we approached it\\ntwo eunuchs came out to meet us.  Their fat bodies swayed as they walked,\\nand they glanced curiously at me with their yellow-lidded eyes.  One of\\nthem drew aside the captain of the guard, and in a low voice whispered to\\nhim.  The other kept munching scented pastilles, which he took with an\\naffected gesture out of an oval box of lilac enamel.\\n\\n‚ÄòAfter a few moments the captain of the guard dismissed the soldiers.\\nThey went back to the palace, the eunuchs following slowly behind and\\nplucking the sweet mulberries from the trees as they passed.  Once the\\nelder of the two turned round, and smiled at me with an evil smile.\\n\\n‚ÄòThen the captain of the guard motioned me towards the entrance of the\\npavilion.  I walked on without trembling, and drawing the heavy curtain\\naside I entered in.\\n\\n‚ÄòThe young Emperor was stretched on a couch of dyed lion skins, and a\\ngerfalcon perched upon his wrist.  Behind him stood a brass-turbaned\\nNubian, naked down to the waist, and with heavy earrings in his split\\nears.  On a table by the side of the couch lay a mighty scimitar of\\nsteel.\\n\\n‚ÄòWhen the Emperor saw me he frowned, and said to me, ‚ÄúWhat is thy name?\\nKnowest thou not that I am Emperor of this city?‚Äù  But I made him no\\nanswer.\\n\\n‚ÄòHe pointed with his finger at the scimitar, and the Nubian seized it,\\nand rushing forward struck at me with great violence.  The blade whizzed\\nthrough me, and did me no hurt.  The man fell sprawling on the floor, and\\nwhen he rose up his teeth chattered with terror and he hid himself behind\\nthe couch.\\n\\n‚ÄòThe Emperor leapt to his feet, and taking a lance from a stand of arms,\\nhe threw it at me.  I caught it in its flight, and brake the shaft into\\ntwo pieces.  He shot at me with an arrow, but I held up my hands and it\\nstopped in mid-air.  Then he drew a dagger from a belt of white leather,\\nand stabbed the Nubian in the throat lest the slave should tell of his\\ndishonour.  The man writhed like a trampled snake, and a red foam bubbled\\nfrom his lips.\\n\\n‚ÄòAs soon as he was dead the Emperor turned to me, and when he had wiped\\naway the bright sweat from his brow with a little napkin of purfled and\\npurple silk, he said to me, ‚ÄúArt thou a prophet, that I may not harm\\nthee, or the son of a prophet, that I can do thee no hurt?  I pray thee\\nleave my city to-night, for while thou art in it I am no longer its\\nlord.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd I answered him, ‚ÄúI will go for half of thy treasure.  Give me half\\nof thy treasure, and I will go away.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄòHe took me by the hand, and led me out into the garden.  When the\\ncaptain of the guard saw me, he wondered.  When the eunuchs saw me, their\\nknees shook and they fell upon the ground in fear.\\n\\n‚ÄòThere is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry,\\nand a brass-sealed ceiling hung with lamps.  The Emperor touched one of\\nthe walls and it opened, and we passed down a corridor that was lit with\\nmany torches.  In niches upon each side stood great wine-jars filled to\\nthe brim with silver pieces.  When we reached the centre of the corridor\\nthe Emperor spake the word that may not be spoken, and a granite door\\nswung back on a secret spring, and he put his hands before his face lest\\nhis eyes should be dazzled.\\n\\n‚ÄòThou couldst not believe how marvellous a place it was.  There were huge\\ntortoise-shells full of pearls, and hollowed moonstones of great size\\npiled up with red rubies.  The gold was stored in coffers of\\nelephant-hide, and the gold-dust in leather bottles.  There were opals\\nand sapphires, the former in cups of crystal, and the latter in cups of\\njade.  Round green emeralds were ranged in order upon thin plates of\\nivory, and in one corner were silk bags filled, some with\\nturquoise-stones, and others with beryls.  The ivory horns were heaped\\nwith purple amethysts, and the horns of brass with chalcedonies and\\nsards.  The pillars, which were of cedar, were hung with strings of\\nyellow lynx-stones.  In the flat oval shields there were carbuncles, both\\nwine-coloured and coloured like grass.  And yet I have told thee but a\\ntithe of what was there.\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd when the Emperor had taken away his hands from before his face he\\nsaid to me: ‚ÄúThis is my house of treasure, and half that is in it is\\nthine, even as I promised to thee.  And I will give thee camels and camel\\ndrivers, and they shall do thy bidding and take thy share of the treasure\\nto whatever part of the world thou desirest to go.  And the thing shall\\nbe done to-night, for I would not that the Sun, who is my father, should\\nsee that there is in my city a man whom I cannot slay.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄòBut I answered him, ‚ÄúThe gold that is here is thine, and the silver also\\nis thine, and thine are the precious jewels and the things of price.  As\\nfor me, I have no need of these.  Nor shall I take aught from thee but\\nthat little ring that thou wearest on the finger of thy hand.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd the Emperor frowned.  ‚ÄúIt is but a ring of lead,‚Äù he cried, ‚Äúnor has\\nit any value.  Therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my\\ncity.‚Äù\\n\\n‚Äò‚ÄúNay,‚Äù I answered, ‚Äúbut I will take nought but that leaden ring, for I\\nknow what is written within it, and for what purpose.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd the Emperor trembled, and besought me and said, ‚ÄúTake all the\\ntreasure and go from my city.  The half that is mine shall be thine\\nalso.‚Äù\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a cave\\nthat is but a day‚Äôs journey from this place have, I hidden the Ring of\\nRiches.  It is but a day‚Äôs journey from this place, and it waits for thy\\ncoming.  He who has this Ring is richer than all the kings of the world.\\nCome therefore and take it, and the world‚Äôs riches shall be thine.‚Äô\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman laughed.  ‚ÄòLove is better than Riches,‚Äô he cried,\\n‚Äòand the little Mermaid loves me.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay, but there is nothing better than Riches,‚Äô said the Soul.\\n\\n‚ÄòLove is better,‚Äô answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the\\ndeep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd after the third year was over, the Soul came down to the shore of the\\nsea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep and\\nsaid, ‚ÄòWhy dost thou call to me?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Soul answered, ‚ÄòCome nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I\\nhave seen marvellous things.‚Äô\\n\\nSo he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head\\nupon his hand and listened.\\n\\nAnd the Soul said to him, ‚ÄòIn a city that I know of there is an inn that\\nstandeth by a river.  I sat there with sailors who drank of two\\ndifferent-coloured wines, and ate bread made of barley, and little salt\\nfish served in bay leaves with vinegar.  And as we sat and made merry,\\nthere entered to us an old man bearing a leathern carpet and a lute that\\nhad two horns of amber.  And when he had laid out the carpet on the\\nfloor, he struck with a quill on the wire strings of his lute, and a girl\\nwhose face was veiled ran in and began to dance before us.  Her face was\\nveiled with a veil of gauze, but her feet were naked.  Naked were her\\nfeet, and they moved over the carpet like little white pigeons.  Never\\nhave I seen anything so marvellous; and the city in which she dances is\\nbut a day‚Äôs journey from this place.‚Äô\\n\\nNow when the young Fisherman heard the words of his Soul, he remembered\\nthat the little Mermaid had no feet and could not dance.  And a great\\ndesire came over him, and he said to himself, ‚ÄòIt is but a day‚Äôs journey,\\nand I can return to my love,‚Äô and he laughed, and stood up in the shallow\\nwater, and strode towards the shore.\\n\\nAnd when he had reached the dry shore he laughed again, and held out his\\narms to his Soul.  And his Soul gave a great cry of joy and ran to meet\\nhim, and entered into him, and the young Fisherman saw stretched before\\nhim upon the sand that shadow of the body that is the body of the Soul.\\n\\nAnd his Soul said to him, ‚ÄòLet us not tarry, but get hence at once, for\\nthe Sea-gods are jealous, and have monsters that do their bidding.‚Äô\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nSo they made haste, and all that night they journeyed beneath the moon,\\nand all the next day they journeyed beneath the sun, and on the evening\\nof the day they came to a city.\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman said to his Soul, ‚ÄòIs this the city in which she\\ndances of whom thou didst speak to me?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‚ÄòIt is not this city, but another.\\nNevertheless let us enter in.‚Äô  So they entered in and passed through the\\nstreets, and as they passed through the Street of the Jewellers the young\\nFisherman saw a fair silver cup set forth in a booth.  And his Soul said\\nto him, ‚ÄòTake that silver cup and hide it.‚Äô\\n\\nSo he took the cup and hid it in the fold of his tunic, and they went\\nhurriedly out of the city.\\n\\nAnd after that they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman\\nfrowned, and flung the cup away, and said to his Soul, ‚ÄòWhy didst thou\\ntell me to take this cup and hide it, for it was an evil thing to do?‚Äô\\n\\nBut his Soul answered him, ‚ÄòBe at peace, be at peace.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd on the evening of the second day they came to a city, and the young\\nFisherman said to his Soul, ‚ÄòIs this the city in which she dances of whom\\nthou didst speak to me?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‚ÄòIt is not this city, but another.\\nNevertheless let us enter in.‚Äô  So they entered in and passed through the\\nstreets, and as they passed through the Street of the Sellers of Sandals,\\nthe young Fisherman saw a child standing by a jar of water.  And his Soul\\nsaid to him, ‚ÄòSmite that child.‚Äô  So he smote the child till it wept, and\\nwhen he had done this they went hurriedly out of the city.\\n\\nAnd after that they had gone a league from the city the young Fisherman\\ngrew wroth, and said to his Soul, ‚ÄòWhy didst thou tell me to smite the\\nchild, for it was an evil thing to do?‚Äô\\n\\nBut his Soul answered him, ‚ÄòBe at peace, be at peace.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd on the evening of the third day they came to a city, and the young\\nFisherman said to his Soul, ‚ÄòIs this the city in which she dances of whom\\nthou didst speak to me?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‚ÄòIt may be that it is in this city, therefore\\nlet us enter in.‚Äô\\n\\nSo they entered in and passed through the streets, but nowhere could the\\nyoung Fisherman find the river or the inn that stood by its side.  And\\nthe people of the city looked curiously at him, and he grew afraid and\\nsaid to his Soul, ‚ÄòLet us go hence, for she who dances with white feet is\\nnot here.‚Äô\\n\\nBut his Soul answered, ‚ÄòNay, but let us tarry, for the night is dark and\\nthere will be robbers on the way.‚Äô\\n\\nSo he sat him down in the market-place and rested, and after a time there\\nwent by a hooded merchant who had a cloak of cloth of Tartary, and bare a\\nlantern of pierced horn at the end of a jointed reed.  And the merchant\\nsaid to him, ‚ÄòWhy dost thou sit in the market-place, seeing that the\\nbooths are closed and the bales corded?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman answered him, ‚ÄòI can find no inn in this city,\\nnor have I any kinsman who might give me shelter.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòAre we not all kinsmen?‚Äô said the merchant.  ‚ÄòAnd did not one God make\\nus?  Therefore come with me, for I have a guest-chamber.‚Äô\\n\\nSo the young Fisherman rose up and followed the merchant to his house.\\nAnd when he had passed through a garden of pomegranates and entered into\\nthe house, the merchant brought him rose-water in a copper dish that he\\nmight wash his hands, and ripe melons that he might quench his thirst,\\nand set a bowl of rice and a piece of roasted kid before him.\\n\\nAnd after that he had finished, the merchant led him to the\\nguest-chamber, and bade him sleep and be at rest.  And the young\\nFisherman gave him thanks, and kissed the ring that was on his hand, and\\nflung himself down on the carpets of dyed goat‚Äôs-hair.  And when he had\\ncovered himself with a covering of black lamb‚Äôs-wool he fell asleep.\\n\\nAnd three hours before dawn, and while it was still night, his Soul waked\\nhim and said to him, ‚ÄòRise up and go to the room of the merchant, even to\\nthe room in which he sleepeth, and slay him, and take from him his gold,\\nfor we have need of it.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman rose up and crept towards the room of the\\nmerchant, and over the feet of the merchant there was lying a curved\\nsword, and the tray by the side of the merchant held nine purses of gold.\\nAnd he reached out his hand and touched the sword, and when he touched it\\nthe merchant started and awoke, and leaping up seized himself the sword\\nand cried to the young Fisherman, ‚ÄòDost thou return evil for good, and\\npay with the shedding of blood for the kindness that I have shown thee?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd his Soul said to the young Fisherman, ‚ÄòStrike him,‚Äô and he struck him\\nso that he swooned and he seized then the nine purses of gold, and fled\\nhastily through the garden of pomegranates, and set his face to the star\\nthat is the star of morning.\\n\\nAnd when they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman beat\\nhis breast, and said to his Soul, ‚ÄòWhy didst thou bid me slay the\\nmerchant and take his gold?  Surely thou art evil.‚Äô\\n\\nBut his Soul answered him, ‚ÄòBe at peace, be at peace.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay,‚Äô cried the young Fisherman, ‚ÄòI may not be at peace, for all that\\nthou hast made me to do I hate.  Thee also I hate, and I bid thee tell me\\nwherefore thou hast wrought with me in this wise.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‚ÄòWhen thou didst send me forth into the world\\nthou gavest me no heart, so I learned to do all these things and love\\nthem.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòWhat sayest thou?‚Äô murmured the young Fisherman.\\n\\n‚ÄòThou knowest,‚Äô answered his Soul, ‚Äòthou knowest it well.  Hast thou\\nforgotten that thou gavest me no heart?  I trow not.  And so trouble not\\nthyself nor me, but be at peace, for there is no pain that thou shalt not\\ngive away, nor any pleasure that thou shalt not receive.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd when the young Fisherman heard these words he trembled and said to\\nhis Soul, ‚ÄòNay, but thou art evil, and hast made me forget my love, and\\nhast tempted me with temptations, and hast set my feet in the ways of\\nsin.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd his Soul answered him, ‚ÄòThou hast not forgotten that when thou didst\\nsend me forth into the world thou gavest me no heart.  Come, let us go to\\nanother city, and make merry, for we have nine purses of gold.‚Äô\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman took the nine purses of gold, and flung them\\ndown, and trampled on them.\\n\\n‚ÄòNay,‚Äô he cried, ‚Äòbut I will have nought to do with thee, nor will I\\njourney with thee anywhere, but even as I sent thee away before, so will\\nI send thee away now, for thou hast wrought me no good.‚Äô  And he turned\\nhis back to the moon, and with the little knife that had the handle of\\ngreen viper‚Äôs skin he strove to cut from his feet that shadow of the body\\nwhich is the body of the Soul.\\n\\nYet his Soul stirred not from him, nor paid heed to his command, but said\\nto him, ‚ÄòThe spell that the Witch told thee avails thee no more, for I\\nmay not leave thee, nor mayest thou drive me forth.  Once in his life may\\na man send his Soul away, but he who receiveth back his Soul must keep it\\nwith him for ever, and this is his punishment and his reward.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the young Fisherman grew pale and clenched his hands and cried, ‚ÄòShe\\nwas a false Witch in that she told me not that.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay,‚Äô answered his Soul, ‚Äòbut she was true to Him she worships, and\\nwhose servant she will be ever.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd when the young Fisherman knew that he could no longer get rid of his\\nSoul, and that it was an evil Soul and would abide with him always, he\\nfell upon the ground weeping bitterly.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd when it was day the young Fisherman rose up and said to his Soul, ‚ÄòI\\nwill bind my hands that I may not do thy bidding, and close my lips that\\nI may not speak thy words, and I will return to the place where she whom\\nI love has her dwelling.  Even to the sea will I return, and to the\\nlittle bay where she is wont to sing, and I will call to her and tell her\\nthe evil I have done and the evil thou hast wrought on me.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd his Soul tempted him and said, ‚ÄòWho is thy love, that thou shouldst\\nreturn to her?  The world has many fairer than she is.  There are the\\ndancing-girls of Samaris who dance in the manner of all kinds of birds\\nand beasts.  Their feet are painted with henna, and in their hands they\\nhave little copper bells.  They laugh while they dance, and their\\nlaughter is as clear as the laughter of water.  Come with me and I will\\nshow them to thee.  For what is this trouble of thine about the things of\\nsin?  Is that which is pleasant to eat not made for the eater?  Is there\\npoison in that which is sweet to drink?  Trouble not thyself, but come\\nwith me to another city.  There is a little city hard by in which there\\nis a garden of tulip-trees.  And there dwell in this comely garden white\\npeacocks and peacocks that have blue breasts.  Their tails when they\\nspread them to the sun are like disks of ivory and like gilt disks.  And\\nshe who feeds them dances for their pleasure, and sometimes she dances on\\nher hands and at other times she dances with her feet.  Her eyes are\\ncoloured with stibium, and her nostrils are shaped like the wings of a\\nswallow.  From a hook in one of her nostrils hangs a flower that is\\ncarved out of a pearl.  She laughs while she dances, and the silver rings\\nthat are about her ankles tinkle like bells of silver.  And so trouble\\nnot thyself any more, but come with me to this city.‚Äô\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but closed his lips with\\nthe seal of silence and with a tight cord bound his hands, and journeyed\\nback to the place from which he had come, even to the little bay where\\nhis love had been wont to sing.  And ever did his Soul tempt him by the\\nway, but he made it no answer, nor would he do any of the wickedness that\\nit sought to make him to do, so great was the power of the love that was\\nwithin him.\\n\\nAnd when he had reached the shore of the sea, he loosed the cord from his\\nhands, and took the seal of silence from his lips, and called to the\\nlittle Mermaid.  But she came not to his call, though he called to her\\nall day long and besought her.\\n\\nAnd his Soul mocked him and said, ‚ÄòSurely thou hast but little joy out of\\nthy love.  Thou art as one who in time of death pours water into a broken\\nvessel.  Thou givest away what thou hast, and nought is given to thee in\\nreturn.  It were better for thee to come with me, for I know where the\\nValley of Pleasure lies, and what things are wrought there.‚Äô\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but in a cleft of the rock\\nhe built himself a house of wattles, and abode there for the space of a\\nyear.  And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he\\ncalled to her again, and at night-time he spake her name.  Yet never did\\nshe rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he\\nfind her though he sought for her in the caves and in the green water, in\\nthe pools of the tide and in the wells that are at the bottom of the\\ndeep.\\n\\nAnd ever did his Soul tempt him with evil, and whisper of terrible\\nthings.  Yet did it not prevail against him, so great was the power of\\nhis love.\\n\\nAnd after the year was over, the Soul thought within himself, ‚ÄòI have\\ntempted my master with evil, and his love is stronger than I am.  I will\\ntempt him now with good, and it may be that he will come with me.‚Äô\\n\\nSo he spake to the young Fisherman and said, ‚ÄòI have told thee of the joy\\nof the world, and thou hast turned a deaf ear to me.  Suffer me now to\\ntell thee of the world‚Äôs pain, and it may be that thou wilt hearken.  For\\nof a truth pain is the Lord of this world, nor is there any one who\\nescapes from its net.  There be some who lack raiment, and others who\\nlack bread.  There be widows who sit in purple, and widows who sit in\\nrags.  To and fro over the fens go the lepers, and they are cruel to each\\nother.  The beggars go up and down on the highways, and their wallets are\\nempty.  Through the streets of the cities walks Famine, and the Plague\\nsits at their gates.  Come, let us go forth and mend these things, and\\nmake them not to be.  Wherefore shouldst thou tarry here calling to thy\\nlove, seeing she comes not to thy call?  And what is love, that thou\\nshouldst set this high store upon it?‚Äô\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman answered it nought, so great was the power of his\\nlove.  And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he\\ncalled to her again, and at night-time he spake her name.  Yet never did\\nshe rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he\\nfind her, though he sought for her in the rivers of the sea, and in the\\nvalleys that are under the waves, in the sea that the night makes purple,\\nand in the sea that the dawn leaves grey.\\n\\nAnd after the second year was over, the Soul said to the young Fisherman\\nat night-time, and as he sat in the wattled house alone, ‚ÄòLo! now I have\\ntempted thee with evil, and I have tempted thee with good, and thy love\\nis stronger than I am.  Wherefore will I tempt thee no longer, but I pray\\nthee to suffer me to enter thy heart, that I may be one with thee even as\\nbefore.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòSurely thou mayest enter,‚Äô said the young Fisherman, ‚Äòfor in the days\\nwhen with no heart thou didst go through the world thou must have much\\nsuffered.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòAlas!‚Äô cried his Soul, ‚ÄòI can find no place of entrance, so compassed\\nabout with love is this heart of thine.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòYet I would that I could help thee,‚Äô said the young Fisherman.\\n\\nAnd as he spake there came a great cry of mourning from the sea, even the\\ncry that men hear when one of the Sea-folk is dead.  And the young\\nFisherman leapt up, and left his wattled house, and ran down to the\\nshore.  And the black waves came hurrying to the shore, bearing with them\\na burden that was whiter than silver.  White as the surf it was, and like\\na flower it tossed on the waves.  And the surf took it from the waves,\\nand the foam took it from the surf, and the shore received it, and lying\\nat his feet the young Fisherman saw the body of the little Mermaid.  Dead\\nat his feet it was lying.\\n\\nWeeping as one smitten with pain he flung himself down beside it, and he\\nkissed the cold red of the mouth, and toyed with the wet amber of the\\nhair.  He flung himself down beside it on the sand, weeping as one\\ntrembling with joy, and in his brown arms he held it to his breast.  Cold\\nwere the lips, yet he kissed them.  Salt was the honey of the hair, yet\\nhe tasted it with a bitter joy.  He kissed the closed eyelids, and the\\nwild spray that lay upon their cups was less salt than his tears.\\n\\nAnd to the dead thing he made confession.  Into the shells of its ears he\\npoured the harsh wine of his tale.  He put the little hands round his\\nneck, and with his fingers he touched the thin reed of the throat.\\nBitter, bitter was his joy, and full of strange gladness was his pain.\\n\\nThe black sea came nearer, and the white foam moaned like a leper.  With\\nwhite claws of foam the sea grabbled at the shore.  From the palace of\\nthe Sea-King came the cry of mourning again, and far out upon the sea the\\ngreat Tritons blew hoarsely upon their horns.\\n\\n‚ÄòFlee away,‚Äô said his Soul, ‚Äòfor ever doth the sea come nigher, and if\\nthou tarriest it will slay thee.  Flee away, for I am afraid, seeing that\\nthy heart is closed against me by reason of the greatness of thy love.\\nFlee away to a place of safety.  Surely thou wilt not send me without a\\nheart into another world?‚Äô\\n\\nBut the young Fisherman listened not to his Soul, but called on the\\nlittle Mermaid and said, ‚ÄòLove is better than wisdom, and more precious\\nthan riches, and fairer than the feet of the daughters of men.  The fires\\ncannot destroy it, nor can the waters quench it.  I called on thee at\\ndawn, and thou didst not come to my call.  The moon heard thy name, yet\\nhadst thou no heed of me.  For evilly had I left thee, and to my own hurt\\nhad I wandered away.  Yet ever did thy love abide with me, and ever was\\nit strong, nor did aught prevail against it, though I have looked upon\\nevil and looked upon good.  And now that thou art dead, surely I will die\\nwith thee also.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd his Soul besought him to depart, but he would not, so great was his\\nlove.  And the sea came nearer, and sought to cover him with its waves,\\nand when he knew that the end was at hand he kissed with mad lips the\\ncold lips of the Mermaid, and the heart that was within him brake.  And\\nas through the fulness of his love his heart did break, the Soul found an\\nentrance and entered in, and was one with him even as before.  And the\\nsea covered the young Fisherman with its waves.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd in the morning the Priest went forth to bless the sea, for it had\\nbeen troubled.  And with him went the monks and the musicians, and the\\ncandle-bearers, and the swingers of censers, and a great company.\\n\\nAnd when the Priest reached the shore he saw the young Fisherman lying\\ndrowned in the surf, and clasped in his arms was the body of the little\\nMermaid.  And he drew back frowning, and having made the sign of the\\ncross, he cried aloud and said, ‚ÄòI will not bless the sea nor anything\\nthat is in it.  Accursed be the Sea-folk, and accursed be all they who\\ntraffic with them.  And as for him who for love‚Äôs sake forsook God, and\\nso lieth here with his leman slain by God‚Äôs judgment, take up his body\\nand the body of his leman, and bury them in the corner of the Field of\\nthe Fullers, and set no mark above them, nor sign of any kind, that none\\nmay know the place of their resting.  For accursed were they in their\\nlives, and accursed shall they be in their deaths also.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the people did as he commanded them, and in the corner of the Field\\nof the Fullers, where no sweet herbs grew, they dug a deep pit, and laid\\nthe dead things within it.\\n\\nAnd when the third year was over, and on a day that was a holy day, the\\nPriest went up to the chapel, that he might show to the people the wounds\\nof the Lord, and speak to them about the wrath of God.\\n\\nAnd when he had robed himself with his robes, and entered in and bowed\\nhimself before the altar, he saw that the altar was covered with strange\\nflowers that never had been seen before.  Strange were they to look at,\\nand of curious beauty, and their beauty troubled him, and their odour was\\nsweet in his nostrils.  And he felt glad, and understood not why he was\\nglad.\\n\\nAnd after that he had opened the tabernacle, and incensed the monstrance\\nthat was in it, and shown the fair wafer to the people, and hid it again\\nbehind the veil of veils, he began to speak to the people, desiring to\\nspeak to them of the wrath of God.  But the beauty of the white flowers\\ntroubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils, and there came\\nanother word into his lips, and he spake not of the wrath of God, but of\\nthe God whose name is Love.  And why he so spake, he knew not.\\n\\nAnd when he had finished his word the people wept, and the Priest went\\nback to the sacristy, and his eyes were full of tears.  And the deacons\\ncame in and began to unrobe him, and took from him the alb and the\\ngirdle, the maniple and the stole.  And he stood as one in a dream.\\n\\nAnd after that they had unrobed him, he looked at them and said, ‚ÄòWhat\\nare the flowers that stand on the altar, and whence do they come?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd they answered him, ‚ÄòWhat flowers they are we cannot tell, but they\\ncome from the corner of the Fullers‚Äô Field.‚Äô  And the Priest trembled,\\nand returned to his own house and prayed.\\n\\nAnd in the morning, while it was still dawn, he went forth with the monks\\nand the musicians, and the candle-bearers and the swingers of censers,\\nand a great company, and came to the shore of the sea, and blessed the\\nsea, and all the wild things that are in it.  The Fauns also he blessed,\\nand the little things that dance in the woodland, and the bright-eyed\\nthings that peer through the leaves.  All the things in God‚Äôs world he\\nblessed, and the people were filled with joy and wonder.  Yet never again\\nin the corner of the Fullers‚Äô Field grew flowers of any kind, but the\\nfield remained barren even as before.  Nor came the Sea-folk into the bay\\nas they had been wont to do, for they went to another part of the sea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE STAR-CHILD\\n\\n\\n                                    TO\\n                           MISS MARGOT TENNANT\\n                              [MRS. ASQUITH]\\n\\nONCE upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home through\\na great pine-forest.  It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.  The\\nsnow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the\\nfrost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they\\npassed: and when they came to the Mountain-Torrent she was hanging\\nmotionless in air, for the Ice-King had kissed her.\\n\\nSo cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to\\nmake of it.\\n\\n‚ÄòUgh!‚Äô snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail\\nbetween his legs, ‚Äòthis is perfectly monstrous weather.  Why doesn‚Äôt the\\nGovernment look to it?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòWeet! weet! weet!‚Äô twittered the green Linnets, ‚Äòthe old Earth is dead\\nand they have laid her out in her white shroud.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòThe Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,‚Äô\\nwhispered the Turtle-doves to each other.  Their little pink feet were\\nquite frost-bitten, but they felt that it was their duty to take a\\nromantic view of the situation.\\n\\n‚ÄòNonsense!‚Äô growled the Wolf.  ‚ÄòI tell you that it is all the fault of\\nthe Government, and if you don‚Äôt believe me I shall eat you.‚Äô  The Wolf\\nhad a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good\\nargument.\\n\\n‚ÄòWell, for my own part,‚Äô said the Woodpecker, who was a born philosopher,\\n‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care an atomic theory for explanations.  If a thing is so, it is\\nso, and at present it is terribly cold.‚Äô\\n\\nTerribly cold it certainly was.  The little Squirrels, who lived inside\\nthe tall fir-tree, kept rubbing each other‚Äôs noses to keep themselves\\nwarm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not\\nventure even to look out of doors.  The only people who seemed to enjoy\\nit were the great horned Owls.  Their feathers were quite stiff with\\nrime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and\\ncalled out to each other across the forest, ‚ÄòTu-whit!  Tu-whoo!  Tu-whit!\\nTu-whoo! what delightful weather we are having!‚Äô\\n\\nOn and on went the two Woodcutters, blowing lustily upon their fingers,\\nand stamping with their huge iron-shod boots upon the caked snow.  Once\\nthey sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when\\nthe stones are grinding; and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice\\nwhere the marsh-water was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their\\nbundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again; and\\nonce they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized\\non them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her\\narms.  But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who watches\\nover all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went warily, and at\\nlast they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw, far down in the\\nvalley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they dwelt.\\n\\nSo overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and\\nthe Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a\\nflower of gold.\\n\\nYet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered\\ntheir poverty, and one of them said to the other, ‚ÄòWhy did we make merry,\\nseeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are?  Better\\nthat we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had\\nfallen upon us and slain us.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòTruly,‚Äô answered his companion, ‚Äòmuch is given to some, and little is\\ngiven to others.  Injustice has parcelled out the world, nor is there\\nequal division of aught save of sorrow.‚Äô\\n\\nBut as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing\\nhappened.  There fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star.  It\\nslipped down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its\\ncourse, and, as they watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink\\nbehind a clump of willow-trees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no\\nmore than a stone‚Äôs-throw away.\\n\\n‚ÄòWhy! there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it,‚Äô they cried, and\\nthey set to and ran, so eager were they for the gold.\\n\\nAnd one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced\\nhis way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo!\\nthere was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.  So he hastened\\ntowards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a\\ncloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many\\nfolds.  And he cried out to his comrade that he had found the treasure\\nthat had fallen from the sky, and when his comrade had come up, they sat\\nthem down in the snow, and loosened the folds of the cloak that they\\nmight divide the pieces of gold.  But, alas! no gold was in it, nor\\nsilver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who\\nwas asleep.\\n\\nAnd one of them said to the other: ‚ÄòThis is a bitter ending to our hope,\\nnor have we any good fortune, for what doth a child profit to a man?  Let\\nus leave it here, and go our way, seeing that we are poor men, and have\\nchildren of our own whose bread we may not give to another.‚Äô\\n\\nBut his companion answered him: ‚ÄòNay, but it were an evil thing to leave\\nthe child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou\\nart, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I\\nbring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.‚Äô\\n\\nSo very tenderly he took up the child, and wrapped the cloak around it to\\nshield it from the harsh cold, and made his way down the hill to the\\nvillage, his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of\\nheart.\\n\\nAnd when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, ‚ÄòThou hast\\nthe child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should\\nshare.‚Äô\\n\\nBut he answered him: ‚ÄòNay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but\\nthe child‚Äôs only,‚Äô and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house\\nand knocked.\\n\\nAnd when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned\\nsafe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took\\nfrom his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots,\\nand bade him come in.\\n\\nBut he said to her, ‚ÄòI have found something in the forest, and I have\\nbrought it to thee to have care of it,‚Äô and he stirred not from the\\nthreshold.\\n\\n‚ÄòWhat is it?‚Äô she cried.  ‚ÄòShow it to me, for the house is bare, and we\\nhave need of many things.‚Äô  And he drew the cloak back, and showed her\\nthe sleeping child.\\n\\n‚ÄòAlack, goodman!‚Äô she murmured, ‚Äòhave we not children of our own, that\\nthou must needs bring a changeling to sit by the hearth?  And who knows\\nif it will not bring us bad fortune?  And how shall we tend it?‚Äô  And she\\nwas wroth against him.\\n\\n‚ÄòNay, but it is a Star-Child,‚Äô he answered; and he told her the strange\\nmanner of the finding of it.\\n\\nBut she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and\\ncried: ‚ÄòOur children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?\\nWho is there who careth for us?  And who giveth us food?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,‚Äô he\\nanswered.\\n\\n‚ÄòDo not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?‚Äô she asked.  ‚ÄòAnd is it\\nnot winter now?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the man answered nothing, but stirred not from the threshold.\\n\\nAnd a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made\\nher tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: ‚ÄòWilt thou not close the\\ndoor?  There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòInto a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter\\nwind?‚Äô he asked.  And the woman answered him nothing, but crept closer to\\nthe fire.\\n\\nAnd after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were\\nfull of tears.  And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms,\\nand she kissed it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of\\ntheir own children was lying.  And on the morrow the Woodcutter took the\\ncurious cloak of gold and placed it in a great chest, and a chain of\\namber that was round the child‚Äôs neck his wife took and set it in the\\nchest also.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nSo the Star-Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and\\nsat at the same board with them, and was their playmate.  And every year\\nhe became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the\\nvillage were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and\\nblack-haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were\\nlike the rings of the daffodil.  His lips, also, were like the petals of\\na red flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water,\\nand his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not.\\n\\nYet did his beauty work him evil.  For he grew proud, and cruel, and\\nselfish.  The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the\\nvillage, he despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he\\nwas noble, being sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over\\nthem, and called them his servants.  No pity had he for the poor, or for\\nthose who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast\\nstones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg\\ntheir bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that\\nvillage to ask for alms.  Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and\\nwould mock at the weakly and ill-favoured, and make jest of them; and\\nhimself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie\\nby the well in the priest‚Äôs orchard and look down at the marvel of his\\nown face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.\\n\\nOften did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: ‚ÄòWe did not\\ndeal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have\\nnone to succour them.  Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?‚Äô\\n\\nOften did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of\\nliving things, saying to him: ‚ÄòThe fly is thy brother.  Do it no harm.\\nThe wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom.  Snare\\nthem not for thy pleasure.  God made the blind-worm and the mole, and\\neach has its place.  Who art thou to bring pain into God‚Äôs world?  Even\\nthe cattle of the field praise Him.‚Äô\\n\\nBut the Star-Child heeded not their words, but would frown and flout, and\\ngo back to his companions, and lead them.  And his companions followed\\nhim, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and\\nmake music.  And wherever the Star-Child led them they followed, and\\nwhatever the Star-Child bade them do, that did they.  And when he pierced\\nwith a sharp reed the dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he\\ncast stones at the leper they laughed also.  And in all things he ruled\\nthem, and they became hard of heart even as he was.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nNow there passed one day through the village a poor beggar-woman.  Her\\ngarments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough\\nroad on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.  And\\nbeing weary she sat her down under a chestnut-tree to rest.\\n\\nBut when the Star-Child saw her, he said to his companions, ‚ÄòSee!  There\\nsitteth a foul beggar-woman under that fair and green-leaved tree.  Come,\\nlet us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill-favoured.‚Äô\\n\\nSo he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked\\nat him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.  And\\nwhen the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what\\nthe Star-Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him:\\n‚ÄòSurely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has\\nthis poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the\\nground, and said, ‚ÄòWho art thou to question me what I do?  I am no son of\\nthine to do thy bidding.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòThou speakest truly,‚Äô answered the Woodcutter, ‚Äòyet did I show thee pity\\nwhen I found thee in the forest.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and fell into a\\nswoon.  And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had\\ncare of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had\\nfallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.\\n\\nBut she would neither eat nor drink, but said to the Woodcutter, ‚ÄòDidst\\nthou not say that the child was found in the forest?  And was it not ten\\nyears from this day?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Woodcutter answered, ‚ÄòYea, it was in the forest that I found him,\\nand it is ten years from this day.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòAnd what signs didst thou find with him?‚Äô she cried.  ‚ÄòBare he not upon\\nhis neck a chain of amber?  Was not round him a cloak of gold tissue\\nbroidered with stars?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòTruly,‚Äô answered the Woodcutter, ‚Äòit was even as thou sayest.‚Äô  And he\\ntook the cloak and the amber chain from the chest where they lay, and\\nshowed them to her.\\n\\nAnd when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, ‚ÄòHe is my little son\\nwhom I lost in the forest.  I pray thee send for him quickly, for in\\nsearch of him have I wandered over the whole world.‚Äô\\n\\nSo the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star-Child, and\\nsaid to him, ‚ÄòGo into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother,\\nwho is waiting for thee.‚Äô\\n\\nSo he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.  But when he saw her\\nwho was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, ‚ÄòWhy, where is my\\nmother?  For I see none here but this vile beggar-woman.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the woman answered him, ‚ÄòI am thy mother.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòThou art mad to say so,‚Äô cried the Star-Child angrily.  ‚ÄòI am no son of\\nthine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.  Therefore get thee\\nhence, and let me see thy foul face no more.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,‚Äô she\\ncried, and she fell on her knees, and held out her arms to him.  ‚ÄòThe\\nrobbers stole thee from me, and left thee to die,‚Äô she murmured, ‚Äòbut I\\nrecognised thee when I saw thee, and the signs also have I recognised,\\nthe cloak of golden tissue and the amber chain.  Therefore I pray thee\\ncome with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.\\nCome with me, my son, for I have need of thy love.‚Äô\\n\\nBut the Star-Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his\\nheart against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the\\nwoman weeping for pain.\\n\\nAnd at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.  ‚ÄòIf in\\nvery truth thou art my mother,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòit had been better hadst thou\\nstayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I\\nthought I was the child of some Star, and not a beggar‚Äôs child, as thou\\ntellest me that I am.  Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no\\nmore.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòAlas! my son,‚Äô she cried, ‚Äòwilt thou not kiss me before I go?  For I\\nhave suffered much to find thee.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay,‚Äô said the Star-Child, ‚Äòbut thou art too foul to look at, and rather\\nwould I kiss the adder or the toad than thee.‚Äô\\n\\nSo the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping bitterly, and\\nwhen the Star-Child saw that she had gone, he was glad, and ran back to\\nhis playmates that he might play with them.\\n\\nBut when they beheld him coming, they mocked him and said, ‚ÄòWhy, thou art\\nas foul as the toad, and as loathsome as the adder.  Get thee hence, for\\nwe will not suffer thee to play with us,‚Äô and they drave him out of the\\ngarden.\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child frowned and said to himself, ‚ÄòWhat is this that they\\nsay to me?  I will go to the well of water and look into it, and it shall\\ntell me of my beauty.‚Äô\\n\\nSo he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his face was\\nas the face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an adder.  And he\\nflung himself down on the grass and wept, and said to himself, ‚ÄòSurely\\nthis has come upon me by reason of my sin.  For I have denied my mother,\\nand driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.  Wherefore I will\\ngo and seek her through the whole world, nor will I rest till I have\\nfound her.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put\\nher hand upon his shoulder and said, ‚ÄòWhat doth it matter if thou hast\\nlost thy comeliness?  Stay with us, and I will not mock at thee.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd he said to her, ‚ÄòNay, but I have been cruel to my mother, and as a\\npunishment has this evil been sent to me.  Wherefore I must go hence, and\\nwander through the world till I find her, and she give me her\\nforgiveness.‚Äô\\n\\nSo he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to\\nhim, but there was no answer.  All day long he called to her, and, when\\nthe sun set he lay down to sleep on a bed of leaves, and the birds and\\nthe animals fled from him, for they remembered his cruelty, and he was\\nalone save for the toad that watched him, and the slow adder that crawled\\npast.\\n\\nAnd in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the\\ntrees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping\\nsorely.  And of everything that he met he made inquiry if perchance they\\nhad seen his mother.\\n\\nHe said to the Mole, ‚ÄòThou canst go beneath the earth.  Tell me, is my\\nmother there?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Mole answered, ‚ÄòThou hast blinded mine eyes.  How should I know?‚Äô\\n\\nHe said to the Linnet, ‚ÄòThou canst fly over the tops of the tall trees,\\nand canst see the whole world.  Tell me, canst thou see my mother?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Linnet answered, ‚ÄòThou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.  How\\nshould I fly?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir-tree, and was lonely, he\\nsaid, ‚ÄòWhere is my mother?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Squirrel answered, ‚ÄòThou hast slain mine.  Dost thou seek to slay\\nthine also?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child wept and bowed his head, and prayed forgiveness of\\nGod‚Äôs things, and went on through the forest, seeking for the\\nbeggar-woman.  And on the third day he came to the other side of the\\nforest and went down into the plain.\\n\\nAnd when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and\\nthrew stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep\\nin the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was\\nhe to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who\\nhad pity on him.  Nor could he hear anywhere of the beggar-woman who was\\nhis mother, though for the space of three years he wandered over the\\nworld, and often seemed to see her on the road in front of him, and would\\ncall to her, and run after her till the sharp flints made his feet to\\nbleed.  But overtake her he could not, and those who dwelt by the way did\\never deny that they had seen her, or any like to her, and they made sport\\nof his sorrow.\\n\\nFor the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in the world\\nthere was neither love nor loving-kindness nor charity for him, but it\\nwas even such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great\\npride.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd one evening he came to the gate of a strong-walled city that stood by\\na river, and, weary and footsore though he was, he made to enter in.  But\\nthe soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the\\nentrance, and said roughly to him, ‚ÄòWhat is thy business in the city?‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòI am seeking for my mother,‚Äô he answered, ‚Äòand I pray ye to suffer me to\\npass, for it may be that she is in this city.‚Äô\\n\\nBut they mocked at him, and one of them wagged a black beard, and set\\ndown his shield and cried, ‚ÄòOf a truth, thy mother will not be merry when\\nshe sees thee, for thou art more ill-favoured than the toad of the marsh,\\nor the adder that crawls in the fen.  Get thee gone.  Get thee gone.  Thy\\nmother dwells not in this city.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd another, who held a yellow banner in his hand, said to him, ‚ÄòWho is\\nthy mother, and wherefore art thou seeking for her?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd he answered, ‚ÄòMy mother is a beggar even as I am, and I have treated\\nher evilly, and I pray ye to suffer me to pass that she may give me her\\nforgiveness, if it be that she tarrieth in this city.‚Äô  But they would\\nnot, and pricked him with their spears.\\n\\nAnd, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with gilt\\nflowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings, came up and\\nmade inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance.  And\\nthey said to him, ‚ÄòIt is a beggar and the child of a beggar, and we have\\ndriven him away.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay,‚Äô he cried, laughing, ‚Äòbut we will sell the foul thing for a slave,\\nand his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd an old and evil-visaged man who was passing by called out, and said,\\n‚ÄòI will buy him for that price,‚Äô and, when he had paid the price, he took\\nthe Star-Child by the hand and led him into the city.\\n\\nAnd after that they had gone through many streets they came to a little\\ndoor that was set in a wall that was covered with a pomegranate tree.\\nAnd the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it\\nopened, and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with\\nblack poppies and green jars of burnt clay.  And the old man took then\\nfrom his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of\\nthe Star-Child, and drave him in front of him.  And when the scarf was\\ntaken off his eyes, the Star-Child found himself in a dungeon, that was\\nlit by a lantern of horn.\\n\\nAnd the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said,\\n‚ÄòEat,‚Äô and some brackish water in a cup and said, ‚ÄòDrink,‚Äô and when he\\nhad eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him\\nand fastening it with an iron chain.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd on the morrow the old man, who was indeed the subtlest of the\\nmagicians of Libya and had learned his art from one who dwelt in the\\ntombs of the Nile, came in to him and frowned at him, and said, ‚ÄòIn a\\nwood that is nigh to the gate of this city of Giaours there are three\\npieces of gold.  One is of white gold, and another is of yellow gold, and\\nthe gold of the third one is red.  To-day thou shalt bring me the piece\\nof white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a\\nhundred stripes.  Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be waiting\\nfor thee at the door of the garden.  See that thou bringest the white\\ngold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have\\nbought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.‚Äô  And he bound the\\neyes of the Star-Child with the scarf of figured silk, and led him\\nthrough the house, and through the garden of poppies, and up the five\\nsteps of brass.  And having opened the little door with his ring he set\\nhim in the street.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child went out of the gate of the city, and came to the wood\\nof which the Magician had spoken to him.\\n\\nNow this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed full of\\nsinging birds and of sweet-scented flowers, and the Star-Child entered it\\ngladly.  Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh\\nbriars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil\\nnettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that\\nhe was in sore distress.  Nor could he anywhere find the piece of white\\ngold of which the Magician had spoken, though he sought for it from morn\\nto noon, and from noon to sunset.  And at sunset he set his face towards\\nhome, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.\\n\\nBut when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a\\nthicket a cry as of some one in pain.  And forgetting his own sorrow he\\nran back to the place, and saw there a little Hare caught in a trap that\\nsome hunter had set for it.\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, ‚ÄòI am\\nmyself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Hare answered him, and said: ‚ÄòSurely thou hast given me freedom,\\nand what shall I give thee in return?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child said to it, ‚ÄòI am seeking for a piece of white gold,\\nnor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will\\nbeat me.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòCome thou with me,‚Äô said the Hare, ‚Äòand I will lead thee to it, for I\\nknow where it is hidden, and for what purpose.‚Äô\\n\\nSo the Star-Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great\\noak-tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.  And he was\\nfilled with joy, and seized it, and said to the Hare, ‚ÄòThe service that I\\ndid to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over, and the\\nkindness that I showed thee thou hast repaid a hundred-fold.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay,‚Äô answered the Hare, ‚Äòbut as thou dealt with me, so I did deal with\\nthee,‚Äô and it ran away swiftly, and the Star-Child went towards the city.\\n\\nNow at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper.  Over\\nhis face hung a cowl of grey linen, and through the eyelets his eyes\\ngleamed like red coals.  And when he saw the Star-Child coming, he struck\\nupon a wooden bowl, and clattered his bell, and called out to him, and\\nsaid, ‚ÄòGive me a piece of money, or I must die of hunger.  For they have\\nthrust me out of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòAlas!‚Äô cried the Star-Child, ‚ÄòI have but one piece of money in my\\nwallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his\\nslave.‚Äô\\n\\nBut the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star-Child had\\npity, and gave him the piece of white gold.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nAnd when he came to the Magician‚Äôs house, the Magician opened to him, and\\nbrought him in, and said to him, ‚ÄòHast thou the piece of white gold?‚Äô\\nAnd the Star-Child answered, ‚ÄòI have it not.‚Äô  So the Magician fell upon\\nhim, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, ‚ÄòEat,‚Äô\\nand an empty cup, and said, ‚ÄòDrink,‚Äô and flung him again into the\\ndungeon.\\n\\nAnd on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, ‚ÄòIf to-day thou\\nbringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my\\nslave, and give thee three hundred stripes.‚Äô\\n\\nSo the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the\\npiece of yellow gold, but nowhere could he find it.  And at sunset he sat\\nhim down and began to weep, and as he was weeping there came to him the\\nlittle Hare that he had rescued from the trap.\\n\\nAnd the Hare said to him, ‚ÄòWhy art thou weeping?  And what dost thou seek\\nin the wood?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child answered, ‚ÄòI am seeking for a piece of yellow gold\\nthat is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and\\nkeep me as a slave.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòFollow me,‚Äô cried the Hare, and it ran through the wood till it came to\\na pool of water.  And at the bottom of the pool the piece of yellow gold\\nwas lying.\\n\\n‚ÄòHow shall I thank thee?‚Äô said the Star-Child, ‚Äòfor lo! this is the\\nsecond time that you have succoured me.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay, but thou hadst pity on me first,‚Äô said the Hare, and it ran away\\nswiftly.\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child took the piece of yellow gold, and put it in his\\nwallet, and hurried to the city.  But the leper saw him coming, and ran\\nto meet him, and knelt down and cried, ‚ÄòGive me a piece of money or I\\nshall die of hunger.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child said to him, ‚ÄòI have in my wallet but one piece of\\nyellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep\\nme as his slave.‚Äô\\n\\nBut the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star-Child had pity on him,\\nand gave him the piece of yellow gold.\\n\\nAnd when he came to the Magician‚Äôs house, the Magician opened to him, and\\nbrought him in, and said to him, ‚ÄòHast thou the piece of yellow gold?‚Äô\\nAnd the Star-Child said to him, ‚ÄòI have it not.‚Äô  So the Magician fell\\nupon him, and beat him, and loaded him with chains, and cast him again\\ninto the dungeon.\\n\\nAnd on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, ‚ÄòIf to-day thou\\nbringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou\\nbringest it not I will surely slay thee.‚Äô\\n\\nSo the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the\\npiece of red gold, but nowhere could he find it.  And at evening he sat\\nhim down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little\\nHare.\\n\\nAnd the Hare said to him, ‚ÄòThe piece of red gold that thou seekest is in\\nthe cavern that is behind thee.  Therefore weep no more but be glad.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòHow shall I reward thee?‚Äô cried the Star-Child, ‚Äòfor lo! this is the\\nthird time thou hast succoured me.‚Äô\\n\\n‚ÄòNay, but thou hadst pity on me first,‚Äô said the Hare, and it ran away\\nswiftly.\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest corner he\\nfound the piece of red gold.  So he put it in his wallet, and hurried to\\nthe city.  And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the\\nroad, and cried out, and said to him, ‚ÄòGive me the piece of red money, or\\nI must die,‚Äô and the Star-Child had pity on him again, and gave him the\\npiece of red gold, saying, ‚ÄòThy need is greater than mine.‚Äô  Yet was his\\nheart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nBut lo! as he passed through the gate of the city, the guards bowed down\\nand made obeisance to him, saying, ‚ÄòHow beautiful is our lord!‚Äô and a\\ncrowd of citizens followed him, and cried out, ‚ÄòSurely there is none so\\nbeautiful in the whole world!‚Äô so that the Star-Child wept, and said to\\nhimself, ‚ÄòThey are mocking me, and making light of my misery.‚Äô  And so\\nlarge was the concourse of the people, that he lost the threads of his\\nway, and found himself at last in a great square, in which there was a\\npalace of a King.\\n\\nAnd the gate of the palace opened, and the priests and the high officers\\nof the city ran forth to meet him, and they abased themselves before him,\\nand said, ‚ÄòThou art our lord for whom we have been waiting, and the son\\nof our King.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child answered them and said, ‚ÄòI am no king‚Äôs son, but the\\nchild of a poor beggar-woman.  And how say ye that I am beautiful, for I\\nknow that I am evil to look at?‚Äô\\n\\nThen he, whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet\\ncrouched a lion that had wings, held up a shield, and cried, ‚ÄòHow saith\\nmy lord that he is not beautiful?‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the Star-Child looked, and lo! his face was even as it had been, and\\nhis comeliness had come back to him, and he saw that in his eyes which he\\nhad not seen there before.\\n\\nAnd the priests and the high officers knelt down and said to him, ‚ÄòIt was\\nprophesied of old that on this day should come he who was to rule over\\nus.  Therefore, let our lord take this crown and this sceptre, and be in\\nhis justice and mercy our King over us.‚Äô\\n\\nBut he said to them, ‚ÄòI am not worthy, for I have denied the mother who\\nbare me, nor may I rest till I have found her, and known her forgiveness.\\nTherefore, let me go, for I must wander again over the world, and may not\\ntarry here, though ye bring me the crown and the sceptre.‚Äô  And as he\\nspake he turned his face from them towards the street that led to the\\ngate of the city, and lo! amongst the crowd that pressed round the\\nsoldiers, he saw the beggar-woman who was his mother, and at her side\\nstood the leper, who had sat by the road.\\n\\nAnd a cry of joy broke from his lips, and he ran over, and kneeling down\\nhe kissed the wounds on his mother‚Äôs feet, and wet them with his tears.\\nHe bowed his head in the dust, and sobbing, as one whose heart might\\nbreak, he said to her: ‚ÄòMother, I denied thee in the hour of my pride.\\nAccept me in the hour of my humility.  Mother, I gave thee hatred.  Do\\nthou give me love.  Mother, I rejected thee.  Receive thy child now.‚Äô\\nBut the beggar-woman answered him not a word.\\n\\nAnd he reached out his hands, and clasped the white feet of the leper,\\nand said to him: ‚ÄòThrice did I give thee of my mercy.  Bid my mother\\nspeak to me once.‚Äô  But the leper answered him not a word.\\n\\nAnd he sobbed again and said: ‚ÄòMother, my suffering is greater than I can\\nbear.  Give me thy forgiveness, and let me go back to the forest.‚Äô  And\\nthe beggar-woman put her hand on his head, and said to him, ‚ÄòRise,‚Äô and\\nthe leper put his hand on his head, and said to him, ‚ÄòRise,‚Äô also.\\n\\nAnd he rose up from his feet, and looked at them, and lo! they were a\\nKing and a Queen.\\n\\nAnd the Queen said to him, ‚ÄòThis is thy father whom thou hast succoured.‚Äô\\n\\nAnd the King said, ‚ÄòThis is thy mother whose feet thou hast washed with\\nthy tears.‚Äô  And they fell on his neck and kissed him, and brought him\\ninto the palace and clothed him in fair raiment, and set the crown upon\\nhis head, and the sceptre in his hand, and over the city that stood by\\nthe river he ruled, and was its lord.  Much justice and mercy did he show\\nto all, and the evil Magician he banished, and to the Woodcutter and his\\nwife he sent many rich gifts, and to their children he gave high honour.\\nNor would he suffer any to be cruel to bird or beast, but taught love and\\nloving-kindness and charity, and to the poor he gave bread, and to the\\nnaked he gave raiment, and there was peace and plenty in the land.\\n\\nYet ruled he not long, so great had been his suffering, and so bitter the\\nfire of his testing, for after the space of three years he died.  And he\\nwho came after him ruled evilly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A HOUSE OF POMEGRANATES***\\n\\n\\n******* This file should be named 873-0.txt or 873-0.zip *******\\n\\n\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/8/7/873\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\nwww.gutenberg.org \\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary \\nArchive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and\\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nFor additional contact information:\\n\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n']"
